-Use of null-co block drivers
-----------------------------
-
-The ``null-co`` block driver is designed for performance: its read accesses are
-not initialized by default. In case this driver has to be used for security

-buffers with zeroes. Security issues reported with the default
-(``read-zeroes=off``) will be discarded.
