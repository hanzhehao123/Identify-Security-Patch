-The ``avocado_qemu.LinuxTest`` base test class
-~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
-
-The ``avocado_qemu.LinuxTest`` is further specialization of the
-``avocado_qemu.Test`` class, so it contains all the characteristics of
-the later plus some extra features.
-
-First of all, this base class is intended for tests that need to
-interact with a fully booted and operational Linux guest.  At this
-time, it uses a Fedora 31 guest image.  The most basic example looks
-like this:
-
-.. code::
-
-  from avocado_qemu import LinuxTest
-
-
-  class SomeTest(LinuxTest):
-
-      def test(self):
-          self.launch_and_wait()
-          self.ssh_command('some_command_to_be_run_in_the_guest')
-
-Please refer to tests that use ``avocado_qemu.LinuxTest`` under
-``tests/acceptance`` for more examples.
