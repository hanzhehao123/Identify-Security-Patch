-QEMU Python Tooling
-===================
-
-This directory houses Python tooling used by the QEMU project to build,
-configure, and test QEMU. It is organized by namespace (``qemu``), and
-then by package (e.g. ``qemu/machine``, ``qemu/qmp``, etc).
-
-``setup.py`` is used by ``pip`` to install this tooling to the current
-environment. ``setup.cfg`` provides the packaging configuration used by
-``setup.py`` in a setuptools specific format. You will generally invoke
-it by doing one of the following:
-
-1. ``pip3 install .`` will install these packages to your current
-   environment. If you are inside a virtual environment, they will
-   install there. If you are not, it will attempt to install to the
-   global environment, which is **not recommended**.
-
-2. ``pip3 install --user .`` will install these packages to your user's
-   local python packages. If you are inside of a virtual environment,
-   this will fail; you likely want the first invocation above.
-
-If you append the ``-e`` argument, pip will install in "editable" mode;
-which installs a version of the package that installs a forwarder
-pointing to these files, such that the package always reflects the
-latest version in your git tree.
-
-See `Installing packages using pip and virtual environments
-<https://packaging.python.org/guides/installing-using-pip-and-virtual-environments/>`_
-for more information.
