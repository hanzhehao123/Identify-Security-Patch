    scripts/qom-fuse: Convert to QOMCommand
    
    Move qom-fuse onto the QOMCommand base established in
    python/qemu/qmp/qom_common.py. The interface doesn't change
    incompatibly, "qom-fuse mountpoint" still works as an invocation, and
    QMP_SOCKET is still used as the environment variable.
