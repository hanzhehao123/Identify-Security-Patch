    python: add Makefile for some common tasks
    
    Add "make venv" to create the pipenv-managed virtual environment that
    contains our explicitly pinned dependencies.
    
    Add "make check" to run the python linters [in the host execution
    environment].
    
    Add "make venv-check" which combines the above two: create/update the
    venv, then run the linters in that explicitly managed environment.
    
    Add "make develop" which canonizes the runes needed to get both the
    linting pre-requisites (the "[devel]" part), and the editable
    live-install (the "-e" part) of these python libraries.
    
    make clean: delete miscellaneous python packaging output possibly
    created by pipenv, pip, or other python packaging utilities
    
    make distclean: delete the above, the .venv, and the editable "qemu"
    package forwarder (qemu.egg-info) if there is one.
