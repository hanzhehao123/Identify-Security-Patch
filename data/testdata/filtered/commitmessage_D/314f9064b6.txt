    pckbd: remove duplicated keyboard and mouse defines
    
    In 2005 the author of commit daa579632d "PS2 mouse and keyboard
    separation (Paul Brook)" and 0e43e99c04 "PS2 mouse and keyboard
    separation (Paul Brook)" separated the PS/2 controller code and
    the PS/2 keyboard and mouse code. It seems he forgot to remove
    a few defines. Remove them now.
