    python: add directory structure README.rst files
    
    Add short readmes to python/, python/qemu/, python/qemu/machine,
    python/qemu/qmp, and python/qemu/utils that explain the directory
    hierarchy. These readmes are visible when browsing the source on
    e.g. gitlab/github and are designed to help new developers/users quickly
    make sense of the source tree.
    
    They are not designed for inclusion in a published manual.
