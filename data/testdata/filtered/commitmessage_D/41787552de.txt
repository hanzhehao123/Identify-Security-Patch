    acceptance tests: bump Avocado version to 88.1
    
    Besides some internal changes, new features, and bug fixes, on the QEMU side,
    this version fixes the following message seen when running the acceptance
    tests: "Error running method "pre_tests" of plugin "fetchasset": 'bytes'
    object has no attribute 'encode'".
    
    The release notes are available at
