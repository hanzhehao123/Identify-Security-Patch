    Merge remote-tracking branch 'remotes/dg-gitlab/tags/ppc-for-6.1-20210603' into staging
    
    ppc patch queue 2021-06-03
    
    Next batch of ppc target patches.  Highlights are:
     * A fix for a regression with single-step mode
     * Start of moving ppc to use decodetree
     * Implementation of some POWER10 64-bit prefixed instructions
     * Several cleanups to softmmu code
     * Continued progress towards allowing --disable-tcg
     * Fix for the POWER PEF implementation
     * Fix for LPCR handling of hotplugged CPUs
     * Assorted other bugfixes and cleanups
    
    This patchset does contain a couple of changes to code outside my
    normal scope of maintainership, related to the removal of cpu_dump and
    cpu_statistics hooks.  ppc was the last target arch implementing these
    at all, and they didn't really do anything there either.  The patches
    should have relevant acks.
