    cpu: Rename CPUClass vmsd -> legacy_vmsd
    
    Quoting Peter Maydell [*]:
    
      There are two ways to handle migration for
      a CPU object:
    
      (1) like any other device, so it has a dc->vmsd that covers
      migration for the whole object. As usual for objects that are a
      subclass of a parent that has state, the first entry in the
      VMStateDescription field list is VMSTATE_CPU(), which migrates
      the cpu_common fields, followed by whatever the CPU's own migration
      fields are.
    
      (2) a backwards-compatible mechanism for CPUs that were
      originally migrated using manual "write fields to the migration
      stream structures". The on-the-wire migration format
      for those is based on the 'env' pointer (which isn't a QOM object),
      and the cpu_common part of the migration data is elsewhere.
    
      cpu_exec_realizefn() handles both possibilities:
    
      * for type 1, dc->vmsd is set and cc->vmsd is not,
        so cpu_exec_realizefn() does nothing, and the standard
        "register dc->vmsd for a device" code does everything needed
    
      * for type 2, dc->vmsd is NULL and so we register the
        vmstate_cpu_common directly to handle the cpu-common fields,
        and the cc->vmsd to handle the per-CPU stuff
    
      You can't change a CPU from one type to the other without breaking
      migration compatibility, which is why some guest architectures
      are stuck on the cc->vmsd form. New targets should use dc->vmsd.
    
    To avoid new targets to start using type (2), rename cc->vmsd as
    cc->legacy_vmsd. The correct field to implement is dc->vmsd (the
    DeviceClass one).
    
    See also commit b170fce3dd0 ("cpu: Register VMStateDescription
    through CPUState") for historic background.
