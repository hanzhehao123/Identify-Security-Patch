    esp: handle non-DMA transfers from the target one byte at a time
    
    The initial implementation of non-DMA transfers was based upon analysis of traces
    from the MacOS toolbox ROM for handling unaligned reads but missed one key
    aspect - during a non-DMA transfer from the target, the bus service interrupt
    should be raised for every single byte received from the bus and not just at either
    the end of the transfer or when the FIFO is full.
    
    Adjust the non-DMA code accordingly so that esp_do_nodma() is called for every byte
    received from the target. This also includes special handling for managing the change
    from DATA IN to STATUS phase as this needs to occur when the final byte is read out
    from the FIFO, and not at the end of the transfer of the last byte into the FIFO.
