    virtiofsd: Get rid of unreachable code in read
    
    pvreadv() can return following.
    
    - error
    - 0 in case of EOF
    - short read
    
    We seem to handle all the cases already. We are retrying read in case
    of short read. So another check for short read seems like dead code.
    Get rid of it.
