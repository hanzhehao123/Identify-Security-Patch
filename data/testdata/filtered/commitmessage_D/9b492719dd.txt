commit 9b492719dd0445c676da6805c84f9a5893583d1c
Author: Rao, Lei <lei.rao@intel.com>

    Add a function named packet_new_nocopy for COLO.
    
    Use the packet_new_nocopy instead of packet_new in the
    filter-rewriter module. There will be one less memory
    copy in the processing of each network packet.
