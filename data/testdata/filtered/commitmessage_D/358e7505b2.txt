    hvf: Move cpu functions into common directory
    
    Until now, Hypervisor.framework has only been available on x86_64 systems.
    With Apple Silicon shipping now, it extends its reach to aarch64. To
    prepare for support for multiple architectures, let's start moving common
    code out into its own accel directory.
    
    This patch moves CPU and memory operations over. While at it, make sure
    the code is consumable on non-i386 systems.
