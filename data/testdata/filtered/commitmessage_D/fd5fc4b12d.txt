    remove qemu-options* from root directory
    
    These headers are also included from softmmu/vl.c, so they should be
    in include/.  Remove qemu-options-wrapper.h, since elsewhere
    we include "template" headers directly and #define the parameters in
    the including file; move qemu-options.h to include/.
