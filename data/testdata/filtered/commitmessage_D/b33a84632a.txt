    crypto: bump min gcrypt to 1.8.0, dropping RHEL-7 support
    
    It has been over two years since RHEL-8 was released, and thus per the
    platform build policy, we no longer need to support RHEL-7 as a build
    target. This lets us increment the minimum required gcrypt version and
    assume that HMAC is always supported
    
    Per repology, current shipping versions are:
    
                 RHEL-8: 1.8.5
          Debian Buster: 1.8.4
     openSUSE Leap 15.2: 1.8.2
       Ubuntu LTS 18.04: 1.8.1
       Ubuntu LTS 20.04: 1.8.5
                FreeBSD: 1.9.2
              Fedora 33: 1.8.6
              Fedora 34: 1.9.3
                OpenBSD: 1.9.3
         macOS HomeBrew: 1.9.3
    
    Ubuntu LTS 18.04 has the oldest version and so 1.8.0 is the new minimum.
