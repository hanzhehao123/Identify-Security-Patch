    s390x/css: Add passthrough IRB
    
    Wire in the subchannel callback for building the IRB
    ESW and ECW space for passthrough devices, and copy
    the hardware's ESW into the IRB we are building.
    
    If the hardware presented concurrent sense, then copy
    that sense data into the IRB's ECW space.
