    KVM: Simplify dirty log sync in kvm_set_phys_mem
    
    kvm_physical_sync_dirty_bitmap() on the whole section is inaccurate, because
    the section can be a superset of the memslot that we're working on.  The result
    is that if the section covers multiple kvm memslots, we could be doing the
    synchronization for multiple times for each kvmslot in the section.
    
    With the two helpers that we just introduced, it's very easy to do it right now
    by calling the helpers.
