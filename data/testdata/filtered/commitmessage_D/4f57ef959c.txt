    target/arm: Make VMOV scalar <-> gpreg beatwise for MVE
    
    In a CPU with MVE, the VMOV (vector lane to general-purpose register)
    and VMOV (general-purpose register to vector lane) insns are not
    predicated, but they are subject to beatwise execution if they
    are not in an IT block.
    
    Since our implementation always executes all 4 beats in one tick,
    this means only that we need to handle PSR.ECI:
     * we must do the usual check for bad ECI state
     * we must advance ECI state if the insn succeeds
     * if ECI says we should not be executing the beat corresponding
       to the lane of the vector register being accessed then we
       should skip performing the move
    
    Note that if PSR.ECI is non-zero then we cannot be in an IT block.
