    i386/cpu_dump: support AVX512 ZMM regs dump
    
    Since commit fa4518741e (target-i386: Rename struct XMMReg to ZMMReg),
    CPUX86State.xmm_regs[] has already been extended to 512bit to support
    AVX512.
    Also, other qemu level supports for AVX512 registers are there for
    years.
    But in x86_cpu_dump_state(), still only dump XMM registers no matter
    YMM/ZMM is enabled.
    This patch is to complement this, let it dump XMM/YMM/ZMM accordingly.
