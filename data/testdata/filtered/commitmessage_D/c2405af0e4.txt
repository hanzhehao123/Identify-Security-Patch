    block/nbd: don't touch s->sioc in nbd_teardown_connection()
    
    Negotiation during reconnect is now done in a thread, and s->sioc is
    not available during negotiation. Negotiation in thread will be
    cancelled by nbd_client_connection_release() called from
    nbd_clear_bdrvstate().  So, we don't need this code chunk anymore.
