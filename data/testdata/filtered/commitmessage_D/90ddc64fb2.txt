    block/nbd: rename NBDConnectThread to NBDClientConnection
    
    We are going to move the connection code to its own file, and want
    clear names and APIs first.
    
    The structure is shared between user and (possibly) several runs of
    connect-thread. So it's wrong to call it "thread". Let's rename to
    something more generic.
    
    Appropriately rename connect_thread and thr variables to conn.
