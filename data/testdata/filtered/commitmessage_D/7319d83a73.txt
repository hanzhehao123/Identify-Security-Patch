    tcg: Combine dh_is_64bit and dh_is_signed to dh_typecode
    
    We will shortly be interested in distinguishing pointers
    from integers in the helper's declaration, as well as a
    true void return.  We currently have two parallel 1 bit
    fields; merge them and expand to a 3 bit field.
    
    Our current maximum is 7 helper arguments, plus the return
    makes 8 * 3 = 24 bits used within the uint32_t typemask.
