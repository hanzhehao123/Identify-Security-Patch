    esp: correctly accumulate extended messages for PDMA
    
    Commit 799d90d818 "esp: transition to message out phase after SATN and stop
    command" added logic to correctly handle extended messages for DMA requests
    but not for PDMA requests.
    
    Apply the same logic in esp_do_dma() to do_dma_pdma_cb() so that extended
    messages terminated with a PDMA request are accumulated correctly. This allows
    the ESP device to respond correctly to the SDTR negotiation initiated by the
    NetBSD ESP driver without causing errors and timeouts on boot.
