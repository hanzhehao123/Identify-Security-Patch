    include/qemu/lockable: Use _Generic instead of QEMU_GENERIC
    
    This is both more and less complicated than our expansion
    using __builtin_choose_expr and __builtin_types_compatible_p.
    
    The expansion through QEMU_MAKE_LOCKABLE_ doesn't work because
    we're not emumerating all of the types within the same _Generic,
    which results in errors about unhandled cases.  We must also
    handle void* explicitly, so that the NULL constant can be used.
