    target/ppc: overhauled and moved logic of storing fpscr
    
    Followed the suggested overhaul to store_fpscr logic, and moved it to
    cpu.c where it can be accessed in !TCG builds.
    
    The overhaul was suggested because storing a value to fpscr should
    never raise an exception, so we could remove all the mess that happened
    with POWERPC_EXCP_FP.
    
    We also moved fpscr_set_rounding_mode into cpu.c as it could now be moved
    there, and it is needed when a value for the fpscr is being stored
    directly.
