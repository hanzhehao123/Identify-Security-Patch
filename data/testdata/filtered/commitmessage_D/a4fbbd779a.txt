    tcg: Change parameters for tcg_target_const_match
    
    Change the return value to bool, because that's what is should
    have been from the start.  Pass the ct mask instead of the whole
    TCGArgConstraint, as that's the only part that's relevant.
    
    Change the value argument to int64_t.  We will need the extra
    width for 32-bit hosts wanting to match vector constants.
