    s390x/tcg: Fix FP CONVERT TO (LOGICAL) FIXED NaN handling
    
    In case we encounter a NaN, we have to return the smallest possible
    number, corresponding to either 0 or the maximum negative number. This
    seems to differ from IEEE handling as implemented in softfloat, whereby
    we return the biggest possible number.
    
    While at it, use float32_to_uint64() in the CLGEB handler.
