    target/ppc: used ternary operator when registering MAS
    
    The write calback decision when registering the MAS SPR has been turned
    into a ternary operation, rather than an if-then-else block.
    
    This was done because when building without TCG, even though the
    compiler will optimize away the pointers to spr_write_generic*, it
    doesn't optimize away the decision and assignment to the local pointer,
    creating compiler errors. This cleanup looked better than using ifdefs,
    so  we decided to with it.
