    target/riscv/pmp: Add assert for ePMP operations
    
    Although we construct epmp_operation in such a way that it can only be
    between 0 and 15 Coverity complains that we don't handle the other
    possible cases. To fix Coverity and make it easier for humans to read
    add a default case to the switch statement that calls
    g_assert_not_reached().
    
    Fixes: CID 1453108
