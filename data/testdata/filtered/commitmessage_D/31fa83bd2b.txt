    tests/tcg/configure.sh: tweak quoting of target_compiler
    
    If you configure the host compiler with a multi-command stanza like:
    
      --cc="ccache gcc"
    
    then the configure.sh machinery falls over with confusion. Work around
    this by ensuring we correctly quote so where we need a complete
    evaluation we get it. Of course the has() check needs single variable
    so we need to unquote that. This does mean it essentially checks that
    just the ccache command exits but if we got past that step we still
    check the compiler actually does something.
