    vfio/migration: Correct device state from vmstate change for savevm case
    
    Set _SAVING flag for device state from vmstate change handler when it
    gets called from savevm.
    
    Currently State transition savevm/suspend is seen as:
        _RUNNING -> _STOP -> Stop-and-copy -> _STOP
    
    State transition savevm/suspend should be:
        _RUNNING -> Stop-and-copy -> _STOP
    
    State transition from _RUNNING to _STOP occurs from
    vfio_vmstate_change() where when vmstate changes from running to
    !running, _RUNNING flag is reset but at the same time when
    vfio_vmstate_change() is called for RUN_STATE_SAVE_VM, _SAVING bit
    should be set.
