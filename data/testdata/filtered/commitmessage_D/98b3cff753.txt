    softfloat: Adjust parts_uncanon_normal for floatx80
    
    With floatx80_precision_x, the rounding happens across
    the break between words.  Notice this case with
    
      frac_lsb = round_mask + 1 -> 0
    
    and check the bits in frac_hi as needed.
    
    In addition, since frac_shift == 0, we won't implicitly clear
    round_mask via the right-shift, so explicitly clear those bits.
    This fixes rounding for floatx80_precision_[sd].
