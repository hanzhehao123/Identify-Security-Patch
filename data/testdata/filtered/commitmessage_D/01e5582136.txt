    i386: always fill Hyper-V CPUID feature leaves from X86CPU data
    
    We have all the required data in X86CPU already and as we are about to
    split hyperv_handle_properties() into hyperv_expand_features()/
    hyperv_fill_cpuids() we can remove the blind copy. The functional change
    is that QEMU won't pass CPUID leaves it doesn't currently know about
    to the guest but arguably this is a good change.
