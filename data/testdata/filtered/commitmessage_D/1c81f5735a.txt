    hw/acpi: Provide function acpi_ghes_present()
    
    Allow code elsewhere in the system to check whether the ACPI GHES
    table is present, so it can determine whether it is OK to try to
    record an error by calling acpi_ghes_record_errors().
    
    (We don't need to migrate the new 'present' field in AcpiGhesState,
    because it is set once at system initialization and doesn't change.)
