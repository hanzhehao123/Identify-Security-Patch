    target/i386: Add CPU model versions supporting 'xsaves'
    
    Hyper-V 2016 refuses to boot on Skylake+ CPU models because they lack
    'xsaves'/'vmx-xsaves' features and this diverges from real hardware. The
    same issue emerges with AMD "EPYC" CPU model prior to version 3 which got
    'xsaves' added. EPYC-Rome/EPYC-Milan CPU models have 'xsaves' enabled from
    the very beginning so the comment blaming KVM to explain why other CPUs
    lack 'xsaves' is likely outdated.
