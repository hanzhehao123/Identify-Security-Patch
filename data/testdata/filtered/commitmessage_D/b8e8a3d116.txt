    block/nbd: drop thr->state
    
    We don't need all these states. The code refactored to use two boolean
    variables looks simpler.
    
    While moving the comment in nbd_co_establish_connection() rework it to
    give better information. Also, we are going to move the connection code
    to separate file and mentioning drained section would be confusing.
    
    Improve also the comment in NBDConnectThread, while dropping removed
    state names from it.
