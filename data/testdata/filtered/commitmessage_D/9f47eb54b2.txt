    target/mips: Remove SmartMIPS / MDMX unuseful comments
    
    These placeholder comments for SmartMIPS and MDMX extensions have
    been added commit 3c824109da0 ("target-mips: microMIPS ASE support").
    More than 11 years later it is safe to assume there won't be added
    soon, so remove these unuseful comments.
