    hw/scsi: Fix sector translation bug in scsi_unmap_complete_noio
    
    check_lba_range expects sectors to be expressed in original qdev blocksize, but
    scsi_unmap_complete_noio was translating them to 512 block sizes, which was
    causing sense errors in the larger LBAs in devices using a 4k block size.
