    coreaudio: Fix output stream format settings
    
    Before commit 7d6948cd98cf5ad8a3458a4ce7fdbcb79bcd1212, it was coded to
    retrieve the initial output stream format settings, modify the frame
    rate, and set again. However, I removed a frame rate modification code by
    mistake in the commit. It also assumes the initial output stream format
    is consistent with what QEMU expects, but that expectation is not in the
    code, which makes it harder to understand and will lead to breakage if
    the initial settings change.
    
    This change explicitly sets all of the output stream settings to solve
    these problems.
