    gitlab: Extract build stages to stages.yml
    
    Extract the build stages used by our job templates to a new file
    (stages.yml) to be able to include it with the other templates,
    without having to run all the jobs included in the default
    .gitlab-ci.yml, which are mainly useful for mainstream CI.
