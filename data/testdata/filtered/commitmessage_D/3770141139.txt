    qemu-config: parse configuration files to a QDict
    
    Change the parser to put the values into a QDict and pass them
    to a callback.  qemu_config_parse's QemuOpts creation is
    itself turned into a callback function.
    
    This is useful for -readconfig to support keyval-based options;
    getting a QDict from the parser removes a roundtrip from
    QDict to QemuOpts and then back to QDict.
    
    Unfortunately there is a disadvantage in that semantic errors will
    point to the last line of the group, because the entries of the QDict
    do not have a location attached.
