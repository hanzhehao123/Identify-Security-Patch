    virtiofsd: get rid of in_sg_left variable
    
    in_sg_left seems to be being used primarly for debugging purpose. It is
    keeping track of how many bytes are left in the scatter list we are
    reading into.
    
    We already have another variable "len" which keeps track how many bytes
    are left to be read. And in_sg_left is greater than or equal to len. We
    have already ensured that in the beginning of function.
    
        if (in_len < tosend_len) {
            fuse_log(FUSE_LOG_ERR, "%s: elem %d too small for data len %zd\n",
                     __func__, elem->index, tosend_len);
            ret = E2BIG;
            goto err;
        }
    
    So in_sg_left seems like a redundant variable. It probably was useful for
    debugging when code was being developed. Get rid of it. It helps simplify
    this function.
