    gitlab: Use $CI_DEFAULT_BRANCH instead of hardcoded 'master'
    
    We want to skip the checkpatch and DCO signoff jobs when
    pushing to the default branch. Currently this branch is
    called 'master', but we don't need to hardcode this in
    the CI configuration, because the $CI_DEFAULT_BRANCH
    env variable exposes it.
