    python/qmp: Fix type of SocketAddrT
    
    In porting the qom tools, qmp-shell, etc; it becomes evident that this
    type is wrong.
    
    This is an integer, not a string. We didn't catch this before because
    none of QEMUMonitorProtocol's *users* happen to be checked, and the
    internal logic of this class is otherwise self-consistent. Additionally,
    mypy was not introspecting into the socket() interface to realize we
    were passing a bad type for AF_INET. Fixed now.
