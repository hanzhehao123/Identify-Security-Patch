    docs/system/arm: Document which architecture extensions we emulate
    
    These days the Arm architecture has a wide range of fine-grained
    optional extra architectural features. We implement quite a lot
    of these but by no means all of them. Document what we do implement,
    so that users can find out without having to dig through back-issues
    of our Changelog on the wiki.
