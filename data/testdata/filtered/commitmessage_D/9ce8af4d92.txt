    target/i386: kvm: add support for TSC scaling
    
    Linux 5.14 will add support for nested TSC scaling.  Add the
    corresponding feature in QEMU; to keep support for existing kernels,
    do not add it to any processor yet.
    
    The handling of the VMCS enumeration MSR is ugly; once we have more than
    one case, we may want to add a table to check VMX features against.
