    block: use GDateTime for formatting timestamp when dumping snapshot info
    
    The GDateTime APIs provided by GLib avoid portability pitfalls, such
    as some platforms where 'struct timeval.tv_sec' field is still 'long'
    instead of 'time_t'. When combined with automatic cleanup, GDateTime
    often results in simpler code too.
