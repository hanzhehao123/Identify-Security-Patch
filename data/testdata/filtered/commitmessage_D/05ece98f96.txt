    vga: Allow writing VBE_DISPI_ID5 to ID register
    
    The highest VBE_DISPI_INDEX_ID version supported by QEMU is
    VBE_DISPI_ID5. But currently QEMU only allows writing values up to
    VBE_DISPI_ID4 to the VBE_DISPI_INDEX_ID register.
    
    As a result of this when a lower version is written to this register and
    later VBE_DISPI_ID5 is written back, reads from the register will
    continue to report the lower version.
    
    Indeed SeaBIOS is doing that during VGA initialization which causes
    guests to always read VBE_DISPI_ID0 instead of the correct version.
