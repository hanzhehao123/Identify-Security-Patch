    target/i386/sev: add support to query the attestation report
    
    The SEV FW >= 0.23 added a new command that can be used to query the
    attestation report containing the SHA-256 digest of the guest memory
    and VMSA encrypted with the LAUNCH_UPDATE and sign it with the PEK.
    
    Note, we already have a command (LAUNCH_MEASURE) that can be used to
    query the SHA-256 digest of the guest memory encrypted through the
    LAUNCH_UPDATE. The main difference between previous and this command
    is that the report is signed with the PEK and unlike the LAUNCH_MEASURE
    command the ATTESATION_REPORT command can be called while the guest
    is running.
    
    Add a QMP interface "query-sev-attestation-report" that can be used
    to get the report encoded in base64.
