    vhost-vdpa: map virtqueue notification area if possible
    
    This patch implements the vq notification mapping support for
    vhost-vDPA. This is simply done by using mmap()/munmap() for the
    vhost-vDPA fd during device start/stop. For the device without
    notification mapping support, we fall back to eventfd based
    notification gracefully.
