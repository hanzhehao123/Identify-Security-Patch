    qmp: Include "share" property of memory backends
    
    Let's include the property, which can be helpful when debugging,
    for example, to spot misuse of MAP_PRIVATE which can result in some ugly
    corner cases (e.g., double-memory consumption on shmem).
    
    Use the same description we also use for describing the property.
