    async: the main AioContext is only "current" if under the BQL
    
    If we want to wake up a coroutine from a worker thread, aio_co_wake()
    currently does not work.  In that scenario, aio_co_wake() calls
    aio_co_enter(), but there is no current AioContext and therefore
    qemu_get_current_aio_context() returns the main thread.  aio_co_wake()
    then attempts to call aio_context_acquire() instead of going through
    aio_co_schedule().
    
    The default case of qemu_get_current_aio_context() was added to cover
    synchronous I/O started from the vCPU thread, but the main and vCPU
    threads are quite different.  The main thread is an I/O thread itself,
    only running a more complicated event loop; the vCPU thread instead
    is essentially a worker thread that occasionally calls
    qemu_mutex_lock_iothread().  It is only in those critical sections
    that it acts as if it were the home thread of the main AioContext.
    
    Therefore, this patch detaches qemu_get_current_aio_context() from
    iothreads, which is a useless complication.  The AioContext pointer
    is stored directly in the thread-local variable, including for the
    main loop.  Worker threads (including vCPU threads) optionally behave
    as temporary home threads if they have taken the big QEMU lock,
    but if that is not the case they will always schedule coroutines
    on remote threads via aio_co_schedule().
    
    With this change, the stub qemu_mutex_iothread_locked() must be changed
    from true to false.  The previous value of true was needed because the
    main thread did not have an AioContext in the thread-local variable,
    but now it does have one.
