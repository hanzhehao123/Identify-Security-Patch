    qemu-config: load modules when instantiating option groups
    
    Right now the SPICE module is special cased to be loaded when processing
    of the -spice command line option.  However, the spice option group
    can also be brought in via -readconfig, in which case the module is
    not loaded.
    
    Add a generic hook to load modules that provide a QemuOpts group,
    and use it for the "spice" and "iscsi" groups.
