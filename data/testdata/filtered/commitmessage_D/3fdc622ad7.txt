    s390x/css: Introduce an ESW struct
    
    The Interrupt Response Block is comprised of several other
    structures concatenated together, but only the 12-byte
    Subchannel-Status Word (SCSW) is defined as a proper struct.
    Everything else is a simple array of 32-bit words.
    
    Let's define a proper struct for the 20-byte Extended-Status
    Word (ESW) so that we can make good decisions about the sense
    data that would go into the ECW area for virtual vs
    passthrough devices.
    
    [CH: adapted ESW definition to build with mingw, as discussed]
