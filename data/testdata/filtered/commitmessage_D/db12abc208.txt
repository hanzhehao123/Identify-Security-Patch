    scripts/qmp-shell: refactor QMPCompleter
    
    list is a generic type, but we expect to use strings directly. We could
    subclass list[str], but pylint does not presently understand that
    invocation.
    
    Change this class to envelop a list instead of *being* a list, for
    simpler mypy typing.
