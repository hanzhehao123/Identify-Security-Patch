    block-copy: streamline choice of copy_range vs. read/write
    
    Put the logic to determine the copy size in a separate function, so
    that there is a simple state machine for the possible methods of
    copying data from one BlockDriverState to the other.
    
    Use .method instead of .copy_range as in-out argument, and
    include also .zeroes as an additional copy method.
    
    While at it, store the common computation of block_copy_max_transfer
    into a new field of BlockCopyState, and make sure that we always
    obey max_transfer; that's more efficient even for the
    COPY_RANGE_READ_WRITE case.
