    i386: introduce hv_cpuid_cache
    
    Just like with cpuid_cache, it makes no sense to call
    KVM_GET_SUPPORTED_HV_CPUID more than once and instead of (ab)using
    env->features[] and/or trying to keep all the code in one place, it is
    better to introduce persistent hv_cpuid_cache and hv_cpuid_get_host()
    accessor to it.
    
    Note, hv_cpuid_get_fw() is converted to using hv_cpuid_get_host()
    just to be removed later with Hyper-V specific feature words.
