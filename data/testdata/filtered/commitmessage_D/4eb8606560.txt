    esp: store lun coming from the MESSAGE OUT phase
    
    The LUN is selected with an IDENTIFY message, and persists
    until the next message out phase.  Instead of passing it to
    do_busid_cmd, store it in ESPState.  Because do_cmd can simply
    skip the message out phase if cmdfifo_cdb_offset is zero, it
    can now be used for the S without ATN cases as well.
