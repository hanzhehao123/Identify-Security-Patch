    tcg: Fix documentation for tcg_constant_* vs tcg_temp_free_*
    
    At some point during the development of tcg_constant_*, I changed
    my mind about whether such temps should be able to be passed to
    tcg_temp_free_*.  The final version committed allows this, but the
    commentary was not updated to match.
