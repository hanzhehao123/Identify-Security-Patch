    minimum required CLang version.
    
    Per repology, currently shipping versions are:
    
                 RHEL-8: 10.0.1
          Debian Buster: 7.0.1
     openSUSE Leap 15.2: 9.0.1
       Ubuntu LTS 18.04: 6.0.0

    With this list Ubuntu LTS 18.04 is the constraint at 6.0.0
    
    An LLVM version of 6.0.0 corresponds to macOS XCode version of 10.0
    which dates from Sept 2018.
