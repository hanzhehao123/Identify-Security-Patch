    KVM: Provide helper to sync dirty bitmap from slot to ramblock
    
    kvm_physical_sync_dirty_bitmap() calculates the ramblock offset in an
    awkward way from the MemoryRegionSection that passed in from the
    caller.  The truth is for each KVMSlot the ramblock offset never
    change for the lifecycle.  Cache the ramblock offset for each KVMSlot
    into the structure when the KVMSlot is created.
    
    With that, we can further simplify kvm_physical_sync_dirty_bitmap()
    with a helper to sync KVMSlot dirty bitmap to the ramblock dirty
    bitmap of a specific KVMSlot.
