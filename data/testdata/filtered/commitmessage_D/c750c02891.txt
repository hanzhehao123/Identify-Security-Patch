    python/qmp: Add qom script rewrites
    
    Inspired by qom-set, qom-get, qom-tree and qom-list; combine all four of
    those scripts into a single script.
    
    A later addition of qom-fuse as an 'extension' necessitates that some
    common features are split out and shared between them.
