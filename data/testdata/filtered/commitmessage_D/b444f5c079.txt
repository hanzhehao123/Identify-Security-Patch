    util/mmap-alloc: Pass flags instead of separate bools to qemu_ram_mmap()
    
    Let's pass flags instead of bools to prepare for passing other flags and
    update the documentation of qemu_ram_mmap(). Introduce new QEMU_MAP_
    flags that abstract the mmap() PROT_ and MAP_ flag handling and simplify
    it.
    
    We expose only flags that are currently supported by qemu_ram_mmap().
    Maybe, we'll see qemu_mmap() in the future as well that can implement these
    flags.
    
    Note: We don't use MAP_ flags as some flags (e.g., MAP_SYNC) are only
    defined for some systems and we want to always be able to identify
    these flags reliably inside qemu_ram_mmap() -- for example, to properly
    warn when some future flags are not available or effective on a system.
    Also, this way we can simplify PROT_ handling as well.
