    python: add tox support
    
    This is intended to be a manually run, non-CI script.
    
    Use tox to test the linters against all python versions from 3.6 to
    3.10. This will only work if you actually have those versions installed
    locally, but Fedora makes this easy:
    
    > sudo dnf install python3.6 python3.7 python3.8 python3.9 python3.10
    
    Unlike the pipenv tests (make venv-check), this pulls "whichever"
    versions of the python packages, so they are unpinned and may break as
    time goes on. In the case that breakages are found, setup.cfg should be
    amended accordingly to avoid the bad dependant versions, or the code
    should be amended to work around the issue.
    
    With confidence that the tests pass on 3.6 through 3.10 inclusive, add
    the appropriate classifiers to setup.cfg to indicate which versions we
    claim to support.
    
    Tox 3.18.0 or above is required to use the 'allowlist_externals' option.
