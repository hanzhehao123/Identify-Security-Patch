    Python: add utility function for retrieving port redirection
    
    Slightly different versions for the same utility code are currently
    present on different locations.  This unifies them all, giving
    preference to the version from virtiofs_submounts.py, because of the
    last tweaks added to it.
    
    While at it, this adds a "qemu.utils" module to host the utility
    function and a test.
