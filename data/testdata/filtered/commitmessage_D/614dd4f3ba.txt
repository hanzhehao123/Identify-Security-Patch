    tcg: Make gen_dup_i32/i64() public as tcg_gen_dup_i32/i64
    
    The Arm MVE VDUP implementation would like to be able to emit code to
    duplicate a byte or halfword value into an i32.  We have code to do
    this already in tcg-op-gvec.c, so all we need to do is make the
    functions global.
    
    For consistency with other functions made available to the frontends:
     * we rename to tcg_gen_dup_*
     * we expose both the _i32 and _i64 forms
     * we provide the #define for a _tl form
