    vl: allow not specifying size in -m when using -M memory-backend
    
    Starting in QEMU 6.0's commit f5c9fcb82d ("vl: separate
    qemu_create_machine", 2020-12-10), a function have_custom_ram_size()
    replaced the return value of set_memory_options().
    
    The purpose of the return value was to record the presence of
    "-m size", and if it was not there, change the default RAM
    size to the size of the memory backend passed with "-M
    memory-backend".
    
    With that commit, however, have_custom_ram_size() is now queried only
    after set_memory_options has stored the fixed-up RAM size in QemuOpts for
    "future use".  This was actually the only future use of the fixed-up RAM
    size, so remove that code and fix the bug.
