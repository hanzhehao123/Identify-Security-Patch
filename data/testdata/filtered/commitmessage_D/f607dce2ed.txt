    hw/net/imx_fec: return 0xffff when accessing non-existing PHY
    
    If a PHY does not exist, attempts to read from it should return 0xffff.
    Otherwise the Linux kernel will believe that a PHY is there and select
    the non-existing PHY. This in turn will result in network errors later
    on since the real PHY is not selected or configured.
    
    Since reading from or writing to a non-existing PHY is not an emulation
    error, replace guest error messages with traces.
    
    Fixes: 461c51ad4275 ("Add a phy-num property to the i.MX FEC emulator")
