    meson: allow optional dependencies for block modules
    
    Right now all dependencies for block modules are passed to
    module_ss.add(when: ...), so they are mandatory.  In the next patch we
    will need to add a libm dependency to a module, but libm does not exist
    on all systems.  So, modify the creation of module_ss and modsrc so that
    dependencies can also be passed to module_ss.add(if_true: ...).
    
    While touching the array, remove the useless dependency of the curl
    module on glib.  glib is always linked in QEMU and in fact all other
    block modules also need it, but they don't have to specify it.
