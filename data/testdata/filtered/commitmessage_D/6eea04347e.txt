    tcg/tci: Implement goto_ptr
    
    This operation is critical to staying within the interpretation
    loop longer, which avoids the overhead of setup and teardown for
    many TBs.
    
    The check in tcg_prologue_init is disabled because TCI does
    want to use NULL to indicate exit, as opposed to branching to
    a real epilogue.
