    channel-socket: Only set CLOEXEC if we have space for fds
    
    MSG_CMSG_CLOEXEC cleans up received fd's; it's really only for Unix
    sockets, but currently we enable it for everything; some socket types
    (IP_MPTCP) don't like this.
    
    Only enable it when we're giving the recvmsg room to receive fd's
    anyway.
