    vhost-vdpa: skip ram device from the IOTLB mapping
    
    vDPA is not tie to any specific hardware, for safety and simplicity,
    vhost-vDPA doesn't allow MMIO area to be mapped via IOTLB. Only the
    doorbell could be mapped via mmap(). So this patch exclude skip the
    ram device from the IOTLB mapping.
