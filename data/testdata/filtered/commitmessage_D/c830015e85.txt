    i386: stop using env->features[] for filling Hyper-V CPUIDs
    
    As a preparatory patch to dropping Hyper-V CPUID leaves from
    feature_word_info[] stop using env->features[] as a temporary
    storage of Hyper-V CPUIDs, just build Hyper-V CPUID leaves directly
    from kvm_hyperv_properties[] data.
