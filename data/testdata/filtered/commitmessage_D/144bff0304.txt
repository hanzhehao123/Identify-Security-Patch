    linux-user: Disable static assert involving __SIGRTMAX if it is missing
    
    This check is to ensure that the loop in signal_table_init() from
    SIGRTMIN to SIGRTMAX falls within the bounds of host_to_target_signal_table
    (_NSIG). However, it is not critical, since _NSIG is already defined
    to be the one larger than the largest signal supported by the system
    (as specified in the upcoming POSIX revision[0]).
    
    musl libc does not define __SIGRTMAX, so disabling this check when
    it is missing fixes one of the last remaining errors when building
    qemu.
