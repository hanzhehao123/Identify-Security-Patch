    virtio-net: Added eBPF RSS to virtio-net.
    
    When RSS is enabled the device tries to load the eBPF program
    to select RX virtqueue in the TUN. If eBPF can be loaded
    the RSS will function also with vhost (works with kernel 5.8 and later).
    Software RSS is used as a fallback with vhost=off when eBPF can't be loaded
    or when hash population requested by the guest.
