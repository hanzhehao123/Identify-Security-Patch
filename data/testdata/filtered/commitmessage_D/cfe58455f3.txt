    hvf: Split out common code on vcpu init and destroy
    
    Until now, Hypervisor.framework has only been available on x86_64 systems.
    With Apple Silicon shipping now, it extends its reach to aarch64. To
    prepare for support for multiple architectures, let's start moving common
    code out into its own accel directory.
    
    This patch splits the vcpu init and destroy functions into a generic and
    an architecture specific portion. This also allows us to move the generic
    functions into the generic hvf code, removing exported functions.
