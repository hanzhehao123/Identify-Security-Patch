    co-queue: drop extra coroutine_fn marks
    
    qemu_co_queue_next() and qemu_co_queue_restart_all() just call
    aio_co_wake() which works well in non-coroutine context. So these
    functions can be called from non-coroutine context as well. And
    actually qemu_co_queue_restart_all() is called from
    nbd_cancel_in_flight(), which is called from non-coroutine context.
