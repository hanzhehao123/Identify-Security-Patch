    scripts/qemu-ga-client: add mypy type hints
    
    This script is in slightly rough shape, but it still works. A lot of
    care went into its initial development. In good faith, I'm updating it
    to the latest Python coding standards. If there is in interest in this
    script, though, I'll be asking for a contributor to take care of it
    further.
