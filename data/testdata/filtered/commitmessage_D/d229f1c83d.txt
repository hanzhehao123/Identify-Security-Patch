    python: Add 'fh' to known-good variable names
    
    fd and fh are fine: we often use these for "file descriptor" or "file
    handle" accordingly. It is rarely the case that you need to enforce a
    more semantically meaningful name beyond "This is the file we are using
    right now."
    
    While we're here: add comments for all of the non-standard pylint
    names. (And the underscore.)
