    Hexagon (target/hexagon) cleanup gen_store_conditional[48] functions
    
    Previously the store-conditional code was writing to hex_pred[prednum].
    Then, the fGEN_TCG override was reading from there to the destination
    variable so that the packet commit logic would handle it properly.
    
    The correct implementation is to write to the destination variable
    and don't have the extra read in the override.
    
    Remove the unused arguments from gen_store_conditional[48]

    Y4_l2fetch == l2fetch(Rs32, Rt32)
    Y5_l2fetch == l2fetch(Rs32, Rtt32)
    
    The semantics for these instructions are present, but the encodings
    are missing.
    
    Note that these are treated as nops in qemu, so we add overrides.

    block-copy: add CoMutex lock
    
    Group various structures fields, to better understand what we need to
    protect with a lock and what doesn't need it.
    Then, add a CoMutex to protect concurrent access of block-copy
    data structures. This mutex also protects .copy_bitmap, because its thread-safe
    API does not prevent it from assigning two tasks to the same
    bitmap region.
    
    Exceptions to the lock:
    - .sleep_state is handled in the series ""coroutine: new sleep/wake API""
    and thus here left as TODO.
    
    - .finished, .cancelled and reads to .ret and .error_is_read will be
    protected in the following patch, because are used also outside
    coroutines.
    
    - .skip_unallocated is atomic. Including it under the mutex would
    increase the critical sections and make them also much more complex.
    We can have it as atomic since it is only written from outside and
    read by block-copy coroutines.

    progressmeter: protect with a mutex
    
    Progressmeter is protected by the AioContext mutex, which
    is taken by the block jobs and their caller (like blockdev).
    
    We would like to remove the dependency of block layer code on the
    AioContext mutex, since most drivers and the core I/O code are already
    not relying on it.
    
    Create a new C file to implement the ProgressMeter API, but keep the
    struct as public, to avoid forcing allocation on the heap.
    
    Also add a mutex to be able to provide an accurate snapshot of the
    progress values to the caller.

    block: add max_hw_transfer to BlockLimits
    
    For block host devices, I/O can happen through either the kernel file
    descriptor I/O system calls (preadv/pwritev, io_submit, io_uring)
    or the SCSI passthrough ioctl SG_IO.
    
    In the latter case, the size of each transfer can be limited by the
    HBA, while for file descriptor I/O the kernel is able to split and
    merge I/O in smaller pieces as needed.  Applying the HBA limits to
    file descriptor I/O results in more system calls and suboptimal
    performance, so this patch splits the max_transfer limit in two:
    max_transfer remains valid and is used in general, while max_hw_transfer
    is limited to the maximum hardware size.  max_hw_transfer can then be
    included by the scsi-generic driver in the block limits page, to ensure
    that the stricter hardware limit is used.

    block-backend: align max_transfer to request alignment
    
    Block device requests must be aligned to bs->bl.request_alignment.
    It makes sense for drivers to align bs->bl.max_transfer the same
    way; however when there is no specified limit, blk_get_max_transfer
    just returns INT_MAX.  Since the contract of the function does not
    specify that INT_MAX means ""no maximum"", just align the outcome
    of the function (whether INT_MAX or bs->bl.max_transfer) before
    returning it.

    scsi-generic: pass max_segments via max_iov field in BlockLimits
    
    I/O to a disk via read/write is not limited by the number of segments allowed
    by the host adapter; the kernel can split requests if needed, and the limit
    imposed by the host adapter can be very low (256k or so) to avoid that SG_IO
    returns EINVAL if memory is heavily fragmented.
    
    Since this value is only interesting for SG_IO-based I/O, do not include
    it in the max_transfer and only take it into account when patching the
    block limits VPD page in the scsi-generic device.

    KVM: Fix dirty ring mmap incorrect size due to renaming accident
    
    Found this when I wanted to try the per-vcpu dirty rate series out, then I
    found that it's not really working and it can quickly hang death a guest.  I
    found strange errors (e.g. guest crash after migration) happens even without
    the per-vcpu dirty rate series.
    
    When merging dirty ring, probably no one notice that the trivial renaming diff
    [1] missed two existing references of kvm_dirty_ring_sizes; they do matter
    since otherwise we'll mmap() a shorter range of memory after the renaming.
    
    I think it didn't SIGBUS for me easily simply because some other stuff within
    qemu mmap()ed right after the dirty rings (e.g. when testing 4096 slots, it
    aligned with one small page on x86), so when we access the rings we've been
    reading/writting to random memory elsewhere of qemu.
    
    Fix the two sizes when map/unmap the shared dirty gfn memory.

    block/snapshot: Clarify goto fallback behavior
    
    In the bdrv_snapshot_goto() fallback code, we work with a pointer to
    either bs->file or bs->backing.  We detach that child, close the node
    (with .bdrv_close()), apply the snapshot on the child node, and then
    re-open the node (with .bdrv_open()).
    
    In order for .bdrv_open() to attach the same child node that we had
    before, we pass ""file={child-node}"" or ""backing={child-node}"" to it.
    Therefore, when .bdrv_open() has returned success, we can assume that
    bs->file or bs->backing (respectively) points to our original child
    again.  This is verified by an assertion.
    
    All of this is not immediately clear from a quick glance at the code,
    so add a comment to the assertion what it is for, and why it is valid.
    It certainly confused Coverity.

    coreaudio: Lock only the buffer
    
    On macOS 11.3.1, Core Audio calls AudioDeviceIOProc after calling an
    internal function named HALB_Mutex::Lock(), which locks a mutex in
    HALB_IOThread::Entry(void*). HALB_Mutex::Lock() is also called in
    AudioObjectGetPropertyData, which is called by coreaudio driver.
    Therefore, a deadlock will occur if coreaudio driver calls
    AudioObjectGetPropertyData while holding a lock for a mutex and tries
    to lock the same mutex in AudioDeviceIOProc.
    
    audioDeviceIOProc, which implements AudioDeviceIOProc in coreaudio
    driver, requires an exclusive access for the device configuration and
    the buffer. Fortunately, a mutex is necessary only for the buffer in
    audioDeviceIOProc because a change for the device configuration occurs
    only before setting up AudioDeviceIOProc or after stopping the playback
    with AudioDeviceStop.
    
    With this change, the mutex owned by the driver will only be used for
    the buffer, and the device configuration change will be protected with
    the implicit iothread mutex.

    Implement the forms of the MVE VLDR and VSTR insns which perform
    non-widening loads of bytes, halfwords or words from memory into
    vector elements of the same width (encodings T5, T6, T7).
    
    (At the moment we know for MVE and M-profile in general that
    vfp_access_check() can never return false, but we include the
    conventional return-true-on-failure check for consistency
    with non-M-profile translation code.)

    target/arm: Handle writeback in VLDR/VSTR sysreg with no memory access
    
    A few subcases of VLDR/VSTR sysreg succeed but do not perform a
    memory access:
     * VSTR of VPR when unprivileged
     * VLDR to VPR when unprivileged
     * VLDR to FPCXT_NS when fpInactive
    
    In these cases, even though we don't do the memory access we should
    still update the base register and perform the stack limit check if
    the insn's addressing mode specifies writeback.  Our implementation
    failed to do this, because we handle these side-effects inside the
    memory_to_fp_sysreg() and fp_sysreg_to_memory() callback functions,
    which are only called if there's something to load or store.
    
    Fix this by adding an extra argument to the callbacks which is set to
    true to actually perform the access and false to only do side effects
    like writeback, and calling the callback with do_access = false
    for the three cases listed above.
    
    This produces slightly suboptimal code for the case of a write
    to FPCXT_NS when the FPU is inactive and the insn didn't have
    side effects (ie no writeback, or via VMSR), in which case we'll
    generate a conditional branch over an unconditional branch.
    But this doesn't seem to be important enough to merit requiring
    the callback to report back whether it generated any code or not.

    s390x/css: Refactor IRB construction
    
    Currently, all subchannel types have ""sense data"" copied into
    the IRB.ECW space, and a couple flags enabled in the IRB.SCSW
    and IRB.ESW. But for passthrough (vfio-ccw) subchannels,
    this data isn't populated in the first place, so enabling
    those flags leads to unexpected behavior if the guest tries to
    process the sense data (zeros) in the IRB.ECW.
    
    Let's add a subchannel callback that builds these portions of
    the IRB, and move the existing code into a routine for those
    virtual subchannels. The passthrough subchannels will be able
    to piggy-back onto this later.

    configure: Check whether we can compile the s390-ccw bios with -msoft-float
    
    The -msoft-float switch is not available in older versions of Clang.
    Since we rely on the compiler to not generate floating point instructions
    unexpectedly, we block those old compilers now via a test in the configure
    script. Note that for some weird reasons, the Clang compiler only complains
    about the missing soft-float support if no other flags are passed via
    ""-Wl,..."" to the linker. So we have to use ""compile_object"" instead of
    ""compile_prog"" for this check.

    scripts/qmp-shell: Fix empty-transaction invocation
    
    calling ""transaction( )"" is pointless, but valid. Rework the parser to
    allow this kind of invocation. This helps clean up exception handling
    later by removing accidental breakages of the parser that aren't
    explicitly forbidden.

    block/nbd: simplify waking of nbd_co_establish_connection()
    
    Instead of managing connect_bh, bh_ctx, and wait_connect fields, we
    can use a single link to the waiting coroutine with proper mutex
    protection.
    
    So new logic is:
    
    nbd_co_establish_connection() sets wait_co under the mutex, releases
    the mutex, then yield()s.  Note that wait_co may be scheduled by the
    thread immediately after unlocking the mutex.  Still, the main thread
    (or iothread) will not reach the code for entering the coroutine until
    the yield(), so we are safe.
    
    connect_thread_func() and nbd_co_establish_connection_cancel() do
    the following to handle wait_co:
    
    Under the mutex, if thr->wait_co is not NULL, make it NULL and
    schedule it. This way, we avoid scheduling the coroutine twice.
    
    Still scheduling is a bit different:
    
    In connect_thread_func() we can just call aio_co_wake under mutex,
    after commit
       [async: the main AioContext is only ""current"" if under the BQL]
    we are sure that aio_co_wake() will not try to acquire the aio context
    and do qemu_aio_coroutine_enter() but simply schedule the coroutine by
    aio_co_schedule().
    
    nbd_co_establish_connection_cancel() will be called from non-coroutine
    context in further patch and will be able to go through
    qemu_aio_coroutine_enter() path of aio_co_wake(). So keep current
    behavior of waking the coroutine after the critical section.
    
    Also, this commit reduces the dependence of
    nbd_co_establish_connection() on the internals of bs (we now use a
    generic pointer to the coroutine, instead of direct use of
    s->connection_co).  This is a step towards splitting the connection
    API out of nbd.c.

    block/nbd: fix how state is cleared on nbd_open() failure paths
    
    We have two ""return error"" paths in nbd_open() after
    nbd_process_options(). Actually we should call nbd_clear_bdrvstate()
    on these paths. Interesting that nbd_process_options() calls
    nbd_clear_bdrvstate() by itself.
    
    Let's fix leaks and refactor things to be more obvious:
    
    - intialize yank at top of nbd_open()
    - move yank cleanup to nbd_clear_bdrvstate()
    - refactor nbd_open() so that all failure paths except for
      yank-register goes through nbd_clear_bdrvstate()

    i386: Add ratelimit for bus locks acquired in guest
    
    A bus lock is acquired through either split locked access to writeback
    (WB) memory or any locked access to non-WB memory. It is typically >1000
    cycles slower than an atomic operation within a cache and can also
    disrupts performance on other cores.
    
    Virtual Machines can exploit bus locks to degrade the performance of
    system. To address this kind of performance DOS attack coming from the
    VMs, bus lock VM exit is introduced in KVM and it can report the bus
    locks detected in guest. If enabled in KVM, it would exit to the
    userspace to let the user enforce throttling policies once bus locks
    acquired in VMs.
    
    The availability of bus lock VM exit can be detected through the
    KVM_CAP_X86_BUS_LOCK_EXIT. The returned bitmap contains the potential
    policies supported by KVM. The field KVM_BUS_LOCK_DETECTION_EXIT in
    bitmap is the only supported strategy at present. It indicates that KVM
    will exit to userspace to handle the bus locks.
    
    This patch adds a ratelimit on the bus locks acquired in guest as a
    mitigation policy.
    
    Introduce a new field ""bus_lock_ratelimit"" to record the limited speed
    of bus locks in the target VM. The user can specify it through the
    ""bus-lock-ratelimit"" as a machine property. In current implementation,
    the default value of the speed is 0 per second, which means no
    restrictions on the bus locks.
    
    As for ratelimit on detected bus locks, simply set the ratelimit
    interval to 1s and restrict the quota of bus lock occurence to the value
    of ""bus_lock_ratelimit"". A potential alternative is to introduce the
    time slice as a property which can help the user achieve more precise
    control.
    
    The detail of bus lock VM exit can be found in spec:

    hw/audio/sb16: Avoid assertion by restricting I/O sampling rate range
    
    While the SB16 seems to work up to 48000 Hz, the ""Sound Blaster Series
    Hardware Programming Guide"" limit the sampling range from 4000 Hz to
    44100 Hz (Section 3-9, 3-10: Digitized Sound I/O Programming, tables
    3-2 and 3-3).
    
    Later, section 6-15 (DSP Commands) is more specific regarding the 41h /
    42h registers (Set digitized sound output sampling rate):
    
      Valid sampling rates range from 5000 to 45000 Hz inclusive.
    
    There is no comment regarding error handling if the register is filled
    with an out-of-range value.  (See also section 3-28 ""8-bit or 16-bit
    Auto-initialize Transfer""). Assume limits are enforced in hardware.
    
    This fixes triggering an assertion in audio_calloc():

    target/arm: Handle VPR semantics in existing code
    
    When MVE is supported, the VPR register has a place on the exception
    stack frame in a previously reserved slot just above the FPSCR.
    It must also be zeroed in various situations when we invalidate
    FPU context.
    
    Update the code which handles the stack frames (exception entry and
    exit code, VLLDM, and VLSTM) to save/restore VPR.
    
    Update code which invalidates FP registers (mostly also exception
    entry and exit code, but also VSCCLRM and the code in
    full_vfp_access_check() that corresponds to the ExecuteFPCheck()
    pseudocode) to zero VPR.

    hostmem: Wire up RAM_NORESERVE via ""reserve"" property
    
    Let's provide a way to control the use of RAM_NORESERVE via memory
    backends using the ""reserve"" property which defaults to true (old
    behavior).
    
    Only Linux currently supports clearing the flag (and support is checked at
    runtime, depending on the setting of ""/proc/sys/vm/overcommit_memory"").
    Windows and other POSIX systems will bail out with ""reserve=false"".
    
    The target use case is virtio-mem, which dynamically exposes memory
    inside a large, sparse memory area to the VM. This essentially allows
    avoiding to set ""/proc/sys/vm/overcommit_memory == 0"") when using
    virtio-mem and also supporting hugetlbfs in the future.
    
    As really only Linux implements RAM_NORESERVE right now, let's expose
    the property only with CONFIG_LINUX. Setting the property to ""false""
    will then only fail in corner cases -- for example on very old kernels
    or when memory overcommit was completely disabled by the admin.

    softmmu/physmem: Fix ram_block_discard_range() to handle shared anonymous memory
    
    We can create shared anonymous memory via
        ""-object memory-backend-ram,share=on,...""
    which is, for example, required by PVRDMA for mremap() to work.
    
    Shared anonymous memory is weird, though. Instead of MADV_DONTNEED, we
    have to use MADV_REMOVE: MADV_DONTNEED will only remove / zap all
    relevant page table entries of the current process, the backend storage
    will not get removed, resulting in no reduced memory consumption and
    a repopulation of previous content on next access.
    
    Shared anonymous memory is internally really just shmem, but without a
    fd exposed. As we cannot use fallocate() without the fd to discard the
    backing storage, MADV_REMOVE gets the same job done without a fd as
    documented in ""man 2 madvise"". Removing backing storage implicitly
    invalidates all page table entries with relevant mappings - an additional
    MADV_DONTNEED is not required.

    esp: fix migration version check in esp_is_version_5()
    
    Commit 4e78f3bf35 ""esp: defer command completion interrupt on incoming data
    transfers"" added a version check for use with VMSTATE_*_TEST macros to allow
    migration from older QEMU versions. Unfortunately the version check fails to
    work in its current form since if the VMStateDescription version_id is
    incremented, the test returns false and so the fields are not included in the
    outgoing migration stream.
    
    Change the version check to use >= rather == to ensure that migration works
    correctly when the ESPState VMStateDescription has version_id > 5.

    esp: revert 75ef849696 ""esp: correctly fill bus id with requested lun""
    
    This commit from nearly 10 years ago is now broken due to the improvements
    in esp emulation (or perhaps was never correct).  It shows up as a bug
    in detecting the CDROM drive under MacOS. The error is caused by the
    MacOS CDROM driver sending this CDB with an ""S without ATN"" command and
    without DMA:
    
        0x12 0x00 0x00 0x00 0x05 0x00 (INQUIRY)
    
    This is a valid INQUIRY command, however with this logic present the 3rd
    byte (0x0) is copied over the 1st byte (0x12) which silently converts the
    INQUIRY command to a TEST UNIT READY command before passing it to the
    QEMU SCSI layer.  Since the TEST UNIT READY command has a zero length
    response the MacOS CDROM driver never receives a response and assumes
    the CDROM is not present.
    
    The logic was to ignore the IDENTIFY byte and copy the LUN over from
    the CDB, which did store the LUN in bits 5-7 of the second byte in
    olden times.  This however is all obsolete, so just drop the code.

    esp: only set ESP_RSEQ at the start of the select sequence
    
    When processing a command to select a target and send a CDB, the ESP device
    maintains a sequence step register so that if an error occurs the host can
    determine which part of the selection/CDB submission sequence failed.
    
    The old Linux 2.6 driver is really pedantic here: it checks the sequence step
    register even if a command succeeds and complains loudly on the console if the
    sequence step register doesn't match the expected bus phase and interrupt flags.
    
    This reason this mismatch occurs is because the ESP emulation currently doesn't
    update the bus phase until the next TI (Transfer Information) command and so the
    cleared sequence step register is considered invalid for the stale bus phase.
    
    Normally this isn't an issue as the host only checks the sequence step register
    if an error occurs but the old Linux 2.6 driver does this in several places
    causing a large stream of ""esp0: STEP_ASEL for tgt 0"" messages to appear on the
    console during the boot process.
    
    Fix this by not clearing the sequence step register when reading the interrupt
    register and clearing the DMA status, so the guest sees a valid sequence step
    and bus phase combination at the end of the command phase. No other change is
    required since the sequence step register is correctly updated throughout the
    selection/CDB submission sequence once one of the select commands is issued.

    block/scsi: correctly emulate the VPD block limits page
    
    When the device doesn't support the VPD block limits page, we emulate it even
    for SCSI passthrough.
    
    As a part of the emulation we need to add it to the 'Supported VPD Pages'
    
    The code that does this adds it to the page, but it doesn't increase the length
    of the data to be copied to the guest, thus the guest never sees the VPD block
    limits page as supported.
    
    Bump the transfer size by 1 in this case.

    Using qemu_opts_absorb_qdict, and then checking for any leftover options,
    is redundant because there is already a function that does the same,
    qemu_opts_from_qdict.  qemu_opts_from_qdict consumes the whole dictionary
    and therefore can just return an error message if an option fails to validate.
    
    This also fixes a bug, because the ""id"" entry was retrieved in

    As a result, it was reported as an unrecognized option.

    block: add trace point when fdatasync fails
    
    A flush failure is a critical failure scenario for some operations.
    For example, it will prevent migration from completing, as it will
    make vm_stop() report an error. Thus it is important to have a
    trace point present for debugging.

    When fdatasync() fails on a file backend we set a flag that
    short-circuits any future attempts to call fdatasync(). The
    first failure returns the true errno, but the later short-
    circuited calls return a generic EIO. The latter is unhelpful
    because fdatasync() can return a variety of errnos, including

    tcg: When allocating for !splitwx, begin with PROT_NONE
    
    There's a change in mprotect() behaviour [1] in the latest macOS
    on M1 and it's not yet clear if it's going to be fixed by Apple.
    
    In this case, instead of changing permissions of N guard pages,
    we change permissions of N rwx regions.  The same number of
    syscalls are required either way.

    When chardev is cleaned up, chr_write_lock needs to be destroyed. But
    the colo-compare module is not cleaned up normally before it when the
    guest poweroff. It is holding chr_write_lock at this time. This will
    cause qemu crash.So we add the function of colo_compare_cleanup() before
    qemu_chr_cleanup() to fix the bug.

    vhost-vdpa: don't initialize backend_features
    
    We used to initialize backend_features during vhost_vdpa_init()
    regardless whether or not it was supported by vhost. This will lead
    the unsupported features like VIRTIO_F_IN_ORDER to be included and set
    to the vhost-vdpa during vhost_dev_start. Because the
    VIRTIO_F_IN_ORDER is not supported by vhost-vdpa so it won't be
    advertised to guest which will break the datapath.
    
    Fix this by not initializing the backend_features, so the
    acked_features could be built only from guest features via
    vhost_net_ack_features().

    yank: Unregister function when using TLS migration
    
    After yank feature was introduced in migration, whenever migration
    is started using TLS, the following error happens in both source and
    destination hosts:
    
    (qemu) qemu-kvm: ../util/yank.c:107: yank_unregister_instance:
    Assertion `QLIST_EMPTY(&entry->yankfns)' failed.
    
    This happens because of a missing yank_unregister_function() when using
    qio-channel-tls.
    
    Fix this by also allowing TYPE_QIO_CHANNEL_TLS object type to perform
    yank_unregister_function() in channel_close() and multifd_load_cleanup().
    
    Also, inside migration_channel_connect() and
    migration_channel_process_incoming() move yank_register_function() so
    it only runs once on a TLS migration.
    
    Fixes: b5eea99ec2f (""migration: Add yank feature"", 2021-01-13)

    Since commit e2e7168a214b0ed98dc357bba96816486a289762, if oprsz
    is still zero(as we don't use this field), simd_desc will trigger an

    Besides, tcg_gen_gvec_*_ptr calls simd_desc in it's implementation.
    Here we pass the value to maxsz and oprsz to bypass the assert.

    target/riscv: fix wfi exception behavior
    
    The wfi exception trigger behavior should take into account user mode,
    hstatus.vtw, and the fact the an wfi might raise different types of
    exceptions depending on various factors:
    
    If supervisor mode is not present:
    
    - an illegal instruction exception should be generated if user mode
    executes and wfi instruction and mstatus.tw = 1.
    
    If supervisor mode is present:
    
    - when a wfi instruction is executed, an illegal exception should be triggered
    if either the current mode is user or the mode is supervisor and mstatus.tw is
    set.
    
    Plus, if the hypervisor extensions are enabled:
    
    - a virtual instruction exception should be raised when a wfi is executed from
    virtual-user or virtual-supervisor and hstatus.vtw is set.

    hw/riscv: microchip_pfsoc: Support direct kernel boot
    
    At present the Microchip Icicle Kit machine only supports using
    '-bios' to load the HSS, and does not support '-kernel' for direct
    kernel booting just like other RISC-V machines do. One has to use
    U-Boot which is chain-loaded by HSS, to load a kernel for testing.
    This is not so convenient.
    
    Adding '-kernel' support together with the existing '-bios', we
    follow the following table to select which payload we execute:
    
      -bios |    -kernel | payload
      ------+------------+--------
          N |          N | HSS
          Y | don't care | HSS
          N |          Y | kernel
    
    This ensures backwards compatibility with how we used to expose
    '-bios' to users. When '-kernel' is used for direct boot, '-dtb'
    must be present to provide a valid device tree for the board,
    as we don't generate device tree.
    
    When direct kernel boot is used, the OpenSBI fw_dynamic BIOS image
    is used to boot a payload like U-Boot or OS kernel directly.
    
    Documentation is updated to describe the direct kernel boot. Note
    as of today there is still no PolarFire SoC support in the upstream
    Linux kernel hence the document does not include instructions for
    that. It will be updated in the future.

    tests/tcg: add a multiarch signals test to stress test signal delivery
    
    This adds a simple signal test that combines the POSIX timer_create
    with signal delivery across multiple threads. The aim is to provide a
    bit more of a stress test to flush out signal handling issues for
    easily than the occasional random crash we sometimes see in linux-test
    or threadcount.

    OpenBSD prior to 6.3 required a workaround to utilize fcntl(F_SETFL) on memory

    Since modern verions of OpenBSD that are only officialy supported and buildable

    target/arm: fix missing exception class
    
    The DAIF and PAC checks used raise_exception_ra to raise an exception
    and unwind CPU state but raise_exception_ra is currently designed for
    handling data aborts as the syndrome is partially precomputed and
    encoded in the TB and then merged in merge_syn_data_abort when handling
    the data abort.  Using raise_exception_ra for DAIF and PAC checks

    Additionally, REQUIRE_64BIT when L=1 to match what is specified in The
    Programming Environments Manual:
    
    ""For 32-bit implementations, the L field must be cleared, otherwise the
    instruction form is invalid.""
    
    Some CPUs are known to deviate from this specification by ignoring the
    L bit [1]. The stricter behavior, however, can help users that test
    software with qemu, making it more likely to detect bugs that would
    otherwise be silent.
    
    If deemed necessary, a future patch can adapt this behavior based on
    the specific CPU model.
    
    [1] The 601 manual is the only one I've found that explicitly states
    that the L bit is ignored, but we also observe this behavior in a 7447A
    v1.2.

    spapr: Set LPCR to current AIL mode when starting a new CPU
    
    TCG does not keep track of AIL mode in a central place, it's based on
    the current LPCR[AIL] bits. Synchronize the new CPU's LPCR to the
    current LPCR in rtas_start_cpu(), similarly to the way the ILE bit is
    synchronized.
    
    Open-code the ILE setting as well now that the caller's LPCR is
    available directly, there is no need for the indirection.
    
    Without this, under both TCG and KVM, adding a POWER8/9/10 class CPU
    with a new core ID after a modern Linux has booted results in the new
    CPU's LPCR missing the LPCR[AIL]=0b11 setting that the other CPUs have.
    This can cause crashes and unexpected behaviour.

    spapr: Fix EEH capability issue on KVM guest for PCI passthru
    
    With upstream kernel, especially after commit 98ba956f6a389
    (""powerpc/pseries/eeh: Rework device EEH PE determination"") we see that KVM
    guest isn't able to enable EEH option for PCI pass-through devices anymore.
    
    [root@atest-guest ~]# dmesg | grep EEH
    [    0.032337] EEH: pSeries platform initialized
    [    0.298207] EEH: No capable adapters found: recovery disabled.
    [root@atest-guest ~]#
    
    So far the linux kernel was assuming pe_config_addr equal to device's
    config_addr and using it to enable EEH on the PE through ibm,set-eeh-option
    RTAS call. Which wasn't the correct way as per PAPR. The linux kernel
    commit 98ba956f6a389 fixed this flow. With that fixed, linux now uses PE
    config address returned by ibm,get-config-addr-info2 RTAS call to enable
    EEH option per-PE basis instead of per-device basis. However this has
    uncovered a bug in qemu where ibm,set-eeh-option is treating PE config
    address as per-device config address.
    
    Hence in qemu guest with recent kernel the ibm,set-eeh-option RTAS call
    fails with -3 return value indicating that there is no PCI device exist for
    the specified PE config address. The rtas_ibm_set_eeh_option call uses
    pci_find_device() to get the PC device that matches specific bus and devfn
    extracted from PE config address passed as argument. Thus it tries to map
    the PE config address to a single specific PCI device 'bus->devices[devfn]'
    which always results into checking device on slot 0 'bus->devices[0]'.
    This succeeds when there is a pass-through device (vfio-pci) present on
    slot 0. But in cases where there is no pass-through device present in slot
    0, but present in non-zero slots, ibm,set-eeh-option call fails to enable
    the EEH capability.
    
    hw/ppc/spapr_pci_vfio.c: spapr_phb_vfio_eeh_set_option()
       case RTAS_EEH_ENABLE: {
            PCIHostState *phb;
            PCIDevice *pdev;
    
            /*
             * The EEH functionality is enabled on basis of PCI device,
             * instead of PE. We need check the validity of the PCI
             * device address.
             */
            phb = PCI_HOST_BRIDGE(sphb);
            pdev = pci_find_device(phb->bus,
                                   (addr >> 16) & 0xFF, (addr >> 8) & 0xFF);
            if (!pdev || !object_dynamic_cast(OBJECT(pdev), ""vfio-pci"")) {
                return RTAS_OUT_PARAM_ERROR;
            }
    
    hw/pci/pci.c:pci_find_device()
    
    PCIDevice *pci_find_device(PCIBus *bus, int bus_num, uint8_t devfn)
    {
        bus = pci_find_bus_nr(bus, bus_num);
    
        if (!bus)
            return NULL;
    
        return bus->devices[devfn];
    }
    
    This patch fixes ibm,set-eeh-option to check for presence of any PCI device
    (vfio-pci) under specified bus and enable the EEH if found. The current
    code already makes sure that all the devices on that bus are from same
    iommu group (within same PE) and fail very early if it does not.
    
    After this fix guest is able to find EEH capable devices and enable EEH
    recovery on it.
    
    [root@atest-guest ~]# dmesg | grep EEH
    [    0.048139] EEH: pSeries platform initialized
    [    0.405115] EEH: Capable adapter found: recovery enabled.

    spapr: Don't hijack current_machine->boot_order
    
    QEMU 6.0 moved all the -boot variables to the machine. Especially, the
    removal of the boot_order static changed the handling of '-boot once'
    from:
    
        if (boot_once) {
            qemu_boot_set(boot_once, &error_fatal);
            qemu_register_reset(restore_boot_order, g_strdup(boot_order));
        }
    
    to
    
        if (current_machine->boot_once) {
            qemu_boot_set(current_machine->boot_once, &error_fatal);
            qemu_register_reset(restore_boot_order,
                                g_strdup(current_machine->boot_order));
        }
    
    This means that we now register as subsequent boot order a copy
    of current_machine->boot_once that was just set with the previous
    call to qemu_boot_set(), i.e. we never transition away from the
    once boot order.
    
    It is certainly fragile^Wwrong for the spapr code to hijack a
    field of the base machine type object like that. The boot order
    rework simply turned this software boundary violation into an
    actual bug.
    
    Have the spapr code to handle that with its own field in
    SpaprMachineState. Also kfree() the initial boot device
    string when ""once"" was used.

    nbd/server: Use drained block ops to quiesce the server
    
    Before switching between AioContexts we need to make sure that we're
    fully quiesced (""nb_requests == 0"" for every client) when entering the
    drained section.
    
    To do this, we set ""quiescing = true"" for every client on
    "".drained_begin"" to prevent new coroutines from being created, and
    check if ""nb_requests == 0"" on "".drained_poll"". Finally, once we're
    exiting the drained section, on "".drained_end"" we set ""quiescing =
    false"" and call ""nbd_client_receive_next_request()"" to resume the
    processing of new requests.
    
    With these changes, ""blk_aio_attach()"" and ""blk_aio_detach()"" can be
    reverted to be as simple as they were before f148ae7d36.

     2. do permission update

    So, on stage [2] we can't say which users are ""old"" and which are

    Recently we've fixed a crash by adding .get_parent_aio_context handler
    to child_vvfat_qcow. Now we want it to support .get_parent_desc as
    well. child_vvfat_qcow wants to implement own .inherit_options, it's
    not bad. But omitting all other handlers is a bad idea. Let's inherit
    the class from child_of_bds instead, similar to chain_child_class and

    If fallocate(... FALLOC_FL_ZERO_RANGE ...) returns EINVAL, it's likely
    an indication that the file system is buggy and does not implement
    unaligned accesses right. We still might be lucky with the other
    fallback fallocate() calls later in this function, though, so we should
    not return immediately and try the others first.
    Since FALLOC_FL_ZERO_RANGE could also return EINVAL if the file descriptor
    is not a regular file, we ignore this filesystem bug silently, without
    printing an error message for the user.

    block/file-posix: Fix problem with fallocate(PUNCH_HOLE) on GPFS
    
    A customer reported that running
    
     qemu-img convert -t none -O qcow2 -f qcow2 input.qcow2 output.qcow2
    
    fails for them with the following error message when the images are
    stored on a GPFS file system :
    
     qemu-img: error while writing sector 0: Invalid argument
    
    After analyzing the strace output, it seems like the problem is in
    handle_aiocb_write_zeroes(): The call to fallocate(FALLOC_FL_PUNCH_HOLE)
    returns EINVAL, which can apparently happen if the file system has
    a different idea of the granularity of the operation. It's arguably
    a bug in GPFS, since the PUNCH_HOLE mode should not result in EINVAL
    according to the man-page of fallocate(), but the file system is out
    there in production and so we have to deal with it. In commit 294682cc3a
    (""block: workaround for unaligned byte range in fallocate()"") we also
    already applied the a work-around for the same problem to the earlier
    fallocate(FALLOC_FL_ZERO_RANGE) call, so do it now similar with the
    PUNCH_HOLE call. But instead of silently catching and returning
    -ENOTSUP (which causes the caller to fall back to writing zeroes),
    let's rather inform the user once about the buggy file system and
    try the other fallback instead.

    block/vvfat: fix vvfat_child_perm crash
    
    It's wrong to rely on s->qcow in vvfat_child_perm, as on permission
    update during bdrv_open_child() call this field is not set yet.
    
    Still prior to aa5a04c7db27eea6b36de32f241b155f0d9ce34d, it didn't
    crash, as bdrv_open_child passed NULL as child to bdrv_child_perm(),
    and NULL was equal to NULL in assertion (still, it was bad guarantee
    for child being s->qcow, not backing :).
    
    Since aa5a04c7db27eea6b36de32f241b155f0d9ce34d
    ""add bdrv_attach_child_noperm"" bdrv_refresh_perms called on parent node
    when attaching child, and new correct child pointer is passed to
    .bdrv_child_perm. Still, s->qcow is NULL at the moment. Let's rely only
    on role instead.
    
    Without that fix,

    block/ssh: Bump minimum libssh version to 0.8.7
    
    It has been over two years since RHEL-8 was released, and thus per the
    platform build policy, we no longer need to support RHEL-7 as a build
    target. So from the RHEL-7 perspective, we do not have to support
    libssh v0.7 anymore now.
    
    Let's look at the versions from other distributions and operating
    systems - according to repology.org, current shipping versions are:
    
                 RHEL-8: 0.9.4
          Debian Buster: 0.8.7
     openSUSE Leap 15.2: 0.8.7
       Ubuntu LTS 18.04: 0.8.0 *
       Ubuntu LTS 20.04: 0.9.3
                FreeBSD: 0.9.5
              Fedora 33: 0.9.5
              Fedora 34: 0.9.5
                OpenBSD: 0.9.5
         macOS HomeBrew: 0.9.5
             HaikuPorts: 0.9.5
    
    * The version of libssh in Ubuntu 18.04 claims to be 0.8.0 from the
    name of the package, but in reality it is a 0.7 patched up as a
    Frankenstein monster with patches from the 0.8 development branch.
    This gave us some headaches in the past already and so it never worked
    with QEMU. All attempts to get it supported have failed in the past,
    patches for QEMU have never been merged and a request to Ubuntu to
    fix it in their 18.04 distro has been ignored:
    
     https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/libssh/+bug/1847514
    
    Thus we really should ignore the libssh in Ubuntu 18.04 in QEMU, too.
    
    Fix it by bumping the minimum libssh version to something that is
    greater than 0.8.0 now. Debian Buster and openSUSE Leap have the
    oldest version and so 0.8.7 is the new minimum.

    gitlab: add python linters to CI
    
    Add a Python container that has just enough juice for us to run the
    Python code quality analysis tools. Base this container on Fedora,
    because Fedora has very convenient packaging for testing multiple Python
    versions.
    
    We need python3, pip (for pulling packages), pipenv and virtualenv for
    creating virtual environments, and tox for running tests. make is needed
    for running 'make check-tox' and 'make venv-check' targets. Python3.10
    is needed explicitly because the tox package only pulls in 3.6-3.9, but
    we wish to test the forthcoming release of Python as well to help
    predict any problems. Lastly, we need gcc to compile PyPI packages that
    may not have a binary distribution available.
    
    Add two tests:
    
    check-python-pipenv uses pipenv to test a frozen, very explicit set of
    packages against our minimum supported python version, Python 3.6. This
    test is not allowed to fail. The dependencies this test uses do not
    change unless python/Pipfile.lock is changed.
    
    check-python-tox uses tox to install the latest versions of required
    python dependencies against a wide array of Python versions from 3.6 to
    3.9, even including the yet-to-be-released Python 3.10. This test is
    allowed to fail with a warning.

    python: add devel package requirements to setuptools
    
    setuptools doesn't have a formal understanding of development requires,
    but it has an optional feataures section. Fine; add a ""devel"" feature
    and add the requirements to it.
    
    To avoid duplication, we can modify pipenv to install qemu[devel]
    instead. This enables us to run invocations like ""pip install -e
    .[devel]"" and test the package on bleeding-edge packages beyond those
    specified in Pipfile.lock.
    
    Importantly, this also allows us to install the qemu development
    packages in a non-networked mode: `pip3 install --no-index -e .[devel]`
    will now fail if the proper development dependencies are not already
    met. This can be useful for automated build scripts where fetching
    network packages may be undesirable.

    python: add mypy to pipenv
    
    0.730 appears to be about the oldest version that works with the
    features we want, including nice human readable output (to make sure
    iotest 297 passes), and type-parameterized Popen generics.
    
    0.770, however, supports adding 'strict' to the config file, so require
    at least 0.770.
    
    Now that we are checking a namespace package, we need to tell mypy to
    allow PEP420 namespaces, so modify the mypy config as part of the move.
    
    mypy can now be run from the python root by typing 'mypy -p qemu'.
    
    A note on mypy invocation: Running it as ""mypy qemu/"" changes the import
    path detection mechanisms in mypy slightly, and it will fail. See
    https://github.com/python/mypy/issues/8584 for a decent entry point with
    more breadcrumbs on the various behaviors that contribute to this subtle
    difference.

    python: add MANIFEST.in
    
    When creating a source or binary distribution via 'python3 setup.py
    <sdist|bdist>', the VERSION and PACKAGE.rst files aren't bundled by
    default. Create a MANIFEST.in file that instructs the build tools to
    include these so that installation from these files won't fail.
    
    This is required by 'tox', as well as by the tooling needed to upload
    packages to PyPI.
    
    Exclude the 'README.rst' file -- that's intended as a guidebook to our
    source tree, not a file that needs to be distributed.

    python/machine: Disable pylint warning for open() in _pre_launch
    
    Shift the open() call later so that the pylint pragma applies *only* to
    that one open() call. Add a note that suggests why this is safe: the
    resource is unconditionally cleaned up in _post_shutdown().
    
    _post_shutdown is called after failed launches (see launch()), and
    unconditionally after every call to shutdown(), and therefore also on

    i386: drop FEAT_HYPERV feature leaves
    
    Hyper-V feature leaves are weird. We have some of them in
    feature_word_info[] array but we don't use feature_word_info
    magic to enable them. Neither do we use feature_dependencies[]
    mechanism to validate the configuration as it doesn't allign
    well with Hyper-V's many-to-many dependency chains. Some of
    the feature leaves hold not only feature bits, but also values.
    E.g. FEAT_HV_NESTED_EAX contains both features and the supported
    Enlightened VMCS range.
    
    Hyper-V features are already represented in 'struct X86CPU' with
    uint64_t hyperv_features so duplicating them in env->features adds
    little (or zero) benefits. THe other half of Hyper-V emulation features
    is also stored with values in hyperv_vendor_id[], hyperv_limits[],...
    so env->features[] is already incomplete.
    
    Remove Hyper-V feature leaves from env->features[] completely.
    kvm_hyperv_properties[] is converted to using raw CPUID func/reg
    pairs for features, this allows us to get rid of hv_cpuid_get_fw()
    conversion.

    hw/usb: hcd-xhci-pci: Fix spec violation of IP flag for MSI/MSI-X
    
    Per xHCI spec v1.2 chapter 4.17.5 page 296:
    
      If MSI or MSI-X interrupts are enabled, Interrupt Pending (IP)
      shall be cleared automatically when the PCI dword write generated
      by the interrupt assertion is complete.
    
    Currently QEMU does not clear the IP flag in the MSI / MSI-X mode.
    This causes subsequent spurious interrupt to be delivered to guests.
    To solve this, we change the xhci intr_raise() hook routine to have
    a bool return value that is passed to its caller (the xhci core),
    with true indicating that IP should be self-cleared.

    gitlab: Run Avocado tests manually (except mainstream CI)
    
    Due to a design problem and misunderstanding between the Avocado
    framework and QEMU, Avocado is fetching many asset artifacts it
    shouldn't be fetching, exhausting the jobs CI timeout.
    
    Since Avocado artifacts are cached, this is not an issue with old
    forks, which already have populated the cache and do not need to
    download new artifacts to run the tests.
    
    However this is very confusing to new contributors who start to
    fork the project and keep having failing CI pipelines.
    
    As a temporary kludge, add the QEMU_CI_AVOCADO_TESTING variable
    to allow old forks to keep running the Avocado tests, while still
    allowing new forks to use the mainstream set of CI tests.
    
    Keep the tests enabled by default on the mainstream namespace
    which is old enough to have a populated cache, hoping we will
    keep this cache long enough until the Avocado/QEMU design issue
    is fixed.

    gitlab: Keep Avocado reports during 1 week
    
    Sometimes pull requests are merged during the week-end, triggering
    a CI pipeline. Currently if such pipeline fails, the Avocado reports
    are available for 2 days. For the reviewers working on the project
    during office hours, the reports are already discarded when they
    want to look at them. Increase this time to 1 week, which should
    give reviewers enough time.
    
    Only keep the reports on failure, which is the only case we'll

    gitlab: Drop linux user build job for CentOS 7
    
    It has been over two years since RHEL-8 was released, and thus per the
    platform build policy, we no longer need to support RHEL-7 as a build
    target.
    
    The build-user-centos7 job was to detect a failure specific to CentOS
    7 and there are already other linux user jobs for other platforms.
    Thus we can drop this job rather than move it to CentOS 8.

    virtio-net: failover: add missing remove_migration_state_change_notifier()
    
    In the failover case configuration, virtio_net_device_realize() uses an
    add_migration_state_change_notifier() to add a state notifier, but this
    notifier is not removed by the unrealize function when the virtio-net
    card is unplugged.
    
    If the card is unplugged and a migration is started, the notifier is
    called and as it is not valid anymore QEMU crashes.
    
    This patch fixes the problem by adding the
    remove_migration_state_change_notifier() in virtio_net_device_unrealize().
    
    The problem can be reproduced with:
    
      $ qemu-system-x86_64 -enable-kvm -m 1g -M q35 \
        -device pcie-root-port,slot=4,id=root1 \

        -device virtio-net-pci,id=net1,mac=52:54:00:6f:55:cc,failover=on,bus=root1 \
        -monitor stdio disk.qcow2

    replay: fix watchpoint processing for reverse debugging
    
    This patch enables reverse debugging with watchpoints.
    Reverse continue scans the execution to find the breakpoints
    and watchpoints that should fire. It uses helper function
    replay_breakpoint() for that. But this function needs to access
    icount, which can't be correct in the middle of TB.
    Therefore, in case of watchpoint, we have to retranslate the block
    to allow this access.

    migration/rdma: Fix cm_event used before being initialized
    
    A segmentation fault was triggered when i try to abort a postcopy + rdma
    migration.
    
    since rdma_ack_cm_event releases a uninitialized cm_event in these case.
    
    like below:
    2496     ret = rdma_get_cm_event(rdma->channel, &cm_event);
    2497     if (ret) {
    2498         perror(""rdma_get_cm_event after rdma_connect"");
    2499         ERROR(errp, ""connecting to destination!"");
    2500         rdma_ack_cm_event(cm_event); <<<< cause segmentation fault
    2501         goto err_rdma_source_connect;
    2502     }
    
    Refer to the rdma_get_cm_event() code, cm_event will be
    updated/changed only if rdma_get_cm_event() returns 0. So it's okey to
    remove the ack in error patch.

    hmp: Fix loadvm to resume the VM on success instead of failure
    
    Commit f61fe11aa6f broke hmp_loadvm() by adding an incorrect negation
    when converting from 0/-errno return values to a bool value. The result
    is that loadvm resumes the VM now if it failed and keeps it stopped if
    it failed. Fix it to restore the old behaviour and do it the other way

    KVM: Disable manual dirty log when dirty ring enabled
    
    KVM_CAP_MANUAL_DIRTY_LOG_PROTECT2 is for KVM_CLEAR_DIRTY_LOG, which is only
    useful for KVM_GET_DIRTY_LOG.  Skip enabling it for kvm dirty ring.
    
    More importantly, KVM_DIRTY_LOG_INITIALLY_SET will not wr-protect all the pages
    initially, which is against how kvm dirty ring is used - there's no way for kvm
    dirty ring to re-protect a page before it's notified as being written first
    with a GFN entry in the ring!  So when KVM_DIRTY_LOG_INITIALLY_SET is enabled
    with dirty ring, we'll see silent data loss after migration.

    KVM: Add dirty-ring-size property
    
    Add a parameter for dirty gfn count for dirty rings.  If zero, dirty ring is
    disabled.  Otherwise dirty ring will be enabled with the per-vcpu gfn count as
    specified.  If dirty ring cannot be enabled due to unsupported kernel or
    illegal parameter, it'll fallback to dirty logging.
    
    By default, dirty ring is not enabled (dirty-gfn-count default to 0).

    KVM: Provide helper to get kvm dirty log
    
    Provide a helper kvm_slot_get_dirty_log() to make the function
    kvm_physical_sync_dirty_bitmap() clearer.  We can even cache the as_id
    into KVMSlot when it is created, so that we don't even need to pass it
    down every time.
    
    Since at it, remove return value of kvm_physical_sync_dirty_bitmap()
    because it should never fail.

    hw/mem/nvdimm: Use Kconfig 'imply' instead of 'depends on'
    
    Per the kconfig.rst:
    
      A device should be listed [...] ``imply`` if (depending on
      the QEMU command line) the board may or  may not be started
      without it.
    
    This is the case with the NVDIMM device, so use the 'imply'
    weak reverse dependency to select the symbol.

    configure: simplify assignment to GIT_SUBMODULES
    
    Do not guard each assignment with a check for --with-git-submodules=ignore.
    To avoid a confusing ""GIT"" line from the Makefile, guard the git-submodule-update
    recipe so that it is empty when --with-git-submodules=ignore.
