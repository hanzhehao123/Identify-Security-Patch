+Program Counter (PC) and other cpu state information (such as the CS
 segment base value) to find the next basic block.
 
-In its simplest, less optimized form, this is done by exiting from the
-current TB, going through the TB epilogue, and then back to the
-main loop. That’s where QEMU looks for the next TB to execute,
-translating it from the guest architecture if it isn’t already available
-in memory. Then QEMU proceeds to execute this next TB, starting at the
-prologue and then moving on to the translated instructions.
-
-Exiting from the TB this way will cause the ``cpu_exec_interrupt()``
-callback to be re-evaluated before executing additional instructions.
-It is mandatory to exit this way after any CPU state changes that may
-unmask interrupts.
-
-In order to accelerate the cases where the TB for the new
-simulated PC is already available, QEMU has mechanisms that allow
-multiple TBs to be chained directly, without having to go back to the
-main loop as described above. These mechanisms are:
-
-``lookup_and_goto_ptr``
-^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
-
-Calling ``tcg_gen_lookup_and_goto_ptr()`` will emit a call to
-``helper_lookup_tb_ptr``. This helper will look for an existing TB that
-matches the current CPU state. If the destination TB is available its
-code address is returned, otherwise the address of the JIT epilogue is
-returned. The call to the helper is always followed by the tcg ``goto_ptr``
-opcode, which branches to the returned address. In this way, we either
-branch to the next TB or return to the main loop.
-
-``goto_tb + exit_tb``
-^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
-
-The translation code usually implements branching by performing the
-following steps:
-
-1. Call ``tcg_gen_goto_tb()`` passing a jump slot index (either 0 or 1)
-   as a parameter.
-
-2. Emit TCG instructions to update the CPU state with any information
-   that has been assumed constant and is required by the main loop to
-   correctly locate and execute the next TB. For most guests, this is
-   just the PC of the branch destination, but others may store additional
-   data. The information updated in this step must be inferable from both
-   ``cpu_get_tb_cpu_state()`` and ``cpu_restore_state()``.
-
-3. Call ``tcg_gen_exit_tb()`` passing the address of the current TB and
-   the jump slot index again.
-
-Step 1, ``tcg_gen_goto_tb()``, will emit a ``goto_tb`` TCG
-instruction that later on gets translated to a jump to an address
-associated with the specified jump slot. Initially, this is the address
-of step 2's instructions, which update the CPU state information. Step 3,
-``tcg_gen_exit_tb()``, exits from the current TB returning a tagged
-pointer composed of the last executed TB’s address and the jump slot
-index.
-
-The first time this whole sequence is executed, step 1 simply jumps
-to step 2. Then the CPU state information gets updated and we exit from
-the current TB. As a result, the behavior is very similar to the less
-optimized form described earlier in this section.
-
-Next, the main loop looks for the next TB to execute using the
-current CPU state information (creating the TB if it wasn’t already
-available) and, before starting to execute the new TB’s instructions,
-patches the previously executed TB by associating one of its jump
-slots (the one specified in the call to ``tcg_gen_exit_tb()``) with the
-address of the new TB.
-
-The next time this previous TB is executed and we get to that same
-``goto_tb`` step, it will already be patched (assuming the destination TB
-is still in memory) and will jump directly to the first instruction of
-the destination TB, without going back to the main loop.
-
-For the ``goto_tb + exit_tb`` mechanism to be used, the following
-conditions need to be satisfied:
-
-* The change in CPU state must be constant, e.g., a direct branch and
-  not an indirect branch.
-
-* The direct branch cannot cross a page boundary. Memory mappings
-  may change, causing the code at the destination address to change.
-
-Note that, on step 3 (``tcg_gen_exit_tb()``), in addition to the
-jump slot index, the address of the TB just executed is also returned.
-This address corresponds to the TB that will be patched; it may be
-different than the one that was directly executed from the main loop
-if the latter had already been chained to other TBs.
+In order to accelerate the most common cases where the new simulated PC
+is known, QEMU can patch a basic block so that it jumps directly to the
+next one.
+
+The most portable code uses an indirect jump. An indirect jump makes
+it easier to make the jump target modification atomic. On some host
+architectures (such as x86 or PowerPC), the ``JUMP`` opcode is
+directly patched so that the block chaining has no overhead.
