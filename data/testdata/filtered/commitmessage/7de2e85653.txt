    yank: Unregister function when using TLS migration
    
    After yank feature was introduced in migration, whenever migration
    is started using TLS, the following error happens in both source and
    destination hosts:
    
    (qemu) qemu-kvm: ../util/yank.c:107: yank_unregister_instance:
    Assertion `QLIST_EMPTY(&entry->yankfns)' failed.
    
    This happens because of a missing yank_unregister_function() when using
    qio-channel-tls.
    
    Fix this by also allowing TYPE_QIO_CHANNEL_TLS object type to perform
    yank_unregister_function() in channel_close() and multifd_load_cleanup().
    
    Also, inside migration_channel_connect() and
    migration_channel_process_incoming() move yank_register_function() so
    it only runs once on a TLS migration.
