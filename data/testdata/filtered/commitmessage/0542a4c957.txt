    python: add mypy to pipenv
    
    0.730 appears to be about the oldest version that works with the
    features we want, including nice human readable output (to make sure
    iotest 297 passes), and type-parameterized Popen generics.
    
    0.770, however, supports adding 'strict' to the config file, so require
    at least 0.770.
    
    Now that we are checking a namespace package, we need to tell mypy to
    allow PEP420 namespaces, so modify the mypy config as part of the move.
    
    mypy can now be run from the python root by typing 'mypy -p qemu'.
    
    A note on mypy invocation: Running it as "mypy qemu/" changes the import
    path detection mechanisms in mypy slightly, and it will fail. See
    https://github.com/python/mypy/issues/8584 for a decent entry point with
    more breadcrumbs on the various behaviors that contribute to this subtle
    difference.
