    python: add devel package requirements to setuptools
    
    setuptools doesn't have a formal understanding of development requires,
    but it has an optional feataures section. Fine; add a "devel" feature
    and add the requirements to it.
    
    To avoid duplication, we can modify pipenv to install qemu[devel]
    instead. This enables us to run invocations like "pip install -e
    .[devel]" and test the package on bleeding-edge packages beyond those
    specified in Pipfile.lock.
    
    Importantly, this also allows us to install the qemu development
    packages in a non-networked mode: `pip3 install --no-index -e .[devel]`
    will now fail if the proper development dependencies are not already
    met. This can be useful for automated build scripts where fetching
    network packages may be undesirable.
