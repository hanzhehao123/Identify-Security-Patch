    target/arm: use raise_exception_ra for stack limit exception
    
    The sequence cpu_restore_state() + raise_exception() is equivalent to
    raise_exception_ra(), so use that instead.  (In this case we never
    cared about the syndrome value, because M-profile doesn't use the
    syndrome; the old code was just written unnecessarily awkwardly.)
