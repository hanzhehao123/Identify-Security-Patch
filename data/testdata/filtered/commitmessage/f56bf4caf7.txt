    gitlab: Run Avocado tests manually (except mainstream CI)
    
    Due to a design problem and misunderstanding between the Avocado
    framework and QEMU, Avocado is fetching many asset artifacts it
    shouldn't be fetching, exhausting the jobs CI timeout.
    
    Since Avocado artifacts are cached, this is not an issue with old
    forks, which already have populated the cache and do not need to
    download new artifacts to run the tests.
    
    However this is very confusing to new contributors who start to
    fork the project and keep having failing CI pipelines.
    
    As a temporary kludge, add the QEMU_CI_AVOCADO_TESTING variable
    to allow old forks to keep running the Avocado tests, while still
    allowing new forks to use the mainstream set of CI tests.
    
    Keep the tests enabled by default on the mainstream namespace
    which is old enough to have a populated cache, hoping we will
    keep this cache long enough until the Avocado/QEMU design issue
    is fixed.
