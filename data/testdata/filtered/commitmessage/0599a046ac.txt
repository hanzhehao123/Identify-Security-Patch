    s390x/css: Refactor IRB construction
    
    Currently, all subchannel types have "sense data" copied into
    the IRB.ECW space, and a couple flags enabled in the IRB.SCSW
    and IRB.ESW. But for passthrough (vfio-ccw) subchannels,
    this data isn't populated in the first place, so enabling
    those flags leads to unexpected behavior if the guest tries to
    process the sense data (zeros) in the IRB.ECW.
    
    Let's add a subchannel callback that builds these portions of
    the IRB, and move the existing code into a routine for those
    virtual subchannels. The passthrough subchannels will be able
    to piggy-back onto this later.
