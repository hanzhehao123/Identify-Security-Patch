    block/file-posix: Try other fallbacks after invalid FALLOC_FL_ZERO_RANGE
    
    If fallocate(... FALLOC_FL_ZERO_RANGE ...) returns EINVAL, it's likely
    an indication that the file system is buggy and does not implement
    unaligned accesses right. We still might be lucky with the other
    fallback fallocate() calls later in this function, though, so we should
    not return immediately and try the others first.
    Since FALLOC_FL_ZERO_RANGE could also return EINVAL if the file descriptor
    is not a regular file, we ignore this filesystem bug silently, without
    printing an error message for the user.
