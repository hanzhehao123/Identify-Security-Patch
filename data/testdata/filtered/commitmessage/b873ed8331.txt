    ppc/pef.c: initialize cgs->ready in kvmppc_svm_init()
    
    QEMU is failing to launch a CGS pSeries guest in a host that has PEF
    support:
    
    qemu-system-ppc64: ../softmmu/vl.c:2585: qemu_machine_creation_done: Assertion `machine->cgs->ready' failed.
    Aborted
    
    This is happening because we're not setting the cgs->ready flag that is
    asserted in qemu_machine_creation_done() during machine start.
    
    cgs->ready is set in s390_pv_kvm_init() and sev_kvm_init(). Let's set it
    in kvmppc_svm_init() as well.
