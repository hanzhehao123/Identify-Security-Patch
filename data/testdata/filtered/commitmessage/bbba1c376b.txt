    block/nbd: fix how state is cleared on nbd_open() failure paths
    
    We have two "return error" paths in nbd_open() after
    nbd_process_options(). Actually we should call nbd_clear_bdrvstate()
    on these paths. Interesting that nbd_process_options() calls
    nbd_clear_bdrvstate() by itself.
    
    Let's fix leaks and refactor things to be more obvious:
    
    - intialize yank at top of nbd_open()
    - move yank cleanup to nbd_clear_bdrvstate()
    - refactor nbd_open() so that all failure paths except for
      yank-register goes through nbd_clear_bdrvstate()
