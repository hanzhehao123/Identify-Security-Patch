    qemu-config: use qemu_opts_from_qdict
    
    Using qemu_opts_absorb_qdict, and then checking for any leftover options,
    is redundant because there is already a function that does the same,
    qemu_opts_from_qdict.  qemu_opts_from_qdict consumes the whole dictionary
    and therefore can just return an error message if an option fails to validate.
    
    This also fixes a bug, because the "id" entry was retrieved in
    qemu_config_do_parse and then left there by qemu_opts_absorb_qdict.
    As a result, it was reported as an unrecognized option.
