    block: preserve errno from fdatasync failures
    
    When fdatasync() fails on a file backend we set a flag that
    short-circuits any future attempts to call fdatasync(). The
    first failure returns the true errno, but the later short-
    circuited calls return a generic EIO. The latter is unhelpful
    because fdatasync() can return a variety of errnos, including
    EACCESS.
