    target/ppc: Move cmp/cmpi/cmpl/cmpli to decodetree
    
    Additionally, REQUIRE_64BIT when L=1 to match what is specified in The
    Programming Environments Manual:
    
    "For 32-bit implementations, the L field must be cleared, otherwise the
    instruction form is invalid."
    
    Some CPUs are known to deviate from this specification by ignoring the
    L bit [1]. The stricter behavior, however, can help users that test
    software with qemu, making it more likely to detect bugs that would
    otherwise be silent.
    
    If deemed necessary, a future patch can adapt this behavior based on
    the specific CPU model.
    
    [1] The 601 manual is the only one I've found that explicitly states
    that the L bit is ignored, but we also observe this behavior in a 7447A
    v1.2.
