    configure: Avoid error messages about missing *-config-*.h files
    
    When compiling with --disable-system there is a harmless yet still
    annoying error message at the end of the "configure" step:
    
     sed: can't read *-config-devices.h: No such file or directory
    
    When only building the tools or docs, without any emulator at all,
    there is even an additional message about missing *-config-target.h
    files.
    
    Fix it by checking whether any of these files are available before
    using them.
    
    Fixes: e0447a834d ("configure: Poison all current target-specific #defines")
