    hw/intc/armv7m_nvic: Remove stale comment
    
    In commit da6d674e509f0939b we split the NVIC code out from the GIC.
    This allowed us to specify the NVIC's default value for the num-irq
    property (64) in the usual way in its property list, and we deleted
    the previous hack where we updated the value in the state struct in
    the instance init function.  Remove a stale comment about that hack
    which we forgot to delete at that time.
