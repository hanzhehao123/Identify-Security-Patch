    nbd/server: Use drained block ops to quiesce the server
    
    Before switching between AioContexts we need to make sure that we're
    fully quiesced ("nb_requests == 0" for every client) when entering the
    drained section.
    
    To do this, we set "quiescing = true" for every client on
    ".drained_begin" to prevent new coroutines from being created, and
    check if "nb_requests == 0" on ".drained_poll". Finally, once we're
    exiting the drained section, on ".drained_end" we set "quiescing =
    false" and call "nbd_client_receive_next_request()" to resume the
    processing of new requests.
    
    With these changes, "blk_aio_attach()" and "blk_aio_detach()" can be
    reverted to be as simple as they were before f148ae7d36.
