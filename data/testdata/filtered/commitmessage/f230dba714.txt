    gitlab: Keep Avocado reports during 1 week
    
    Sometimes pull requests are merged during the week-end, triggering
    a CI pipeline. Currently if such pipeline fails, the Avocado reports
    are available for 2 days. For the reviewers working on the project
    during office hours, the reports are already discarded when they
    want to look at them. Increase this time to 1 week, which should
    give reviewers enough time.
    
    Only keep the reports on failure, which is the only case we'll
    look at them.
