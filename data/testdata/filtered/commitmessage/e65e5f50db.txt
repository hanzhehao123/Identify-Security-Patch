    KVM: Provide helper to get kvm dirty log
    
    Provide a helper kvm_slot_get_dirty_log() to make the function
    kvm_physical_sync_dirty_bitmap() clearer.  We can even cache the as_id
    into KVMSlot when it is created, so that we don't even need to pass it
    down every time.
    
    Since at it, remove return value of kvm_physical_sync_dirty_bitmap()
    because it should never fail.
