    esp: fix migration version check in esp_is_version_5()
    
    Commit 4e78f3bf35 "esp: defer command completion interrupt on incoming data
    transfers" added a version check for use with VMSTATE_*_TEST macros to allow
    migration from older QEMU versions. Unfortunately the version check fails to
    work in its current form since if the VMStateDescription version_id is
    incremented, the test returns false and so the fields are not included in the
    outgoing migration stream.
    
    Change the version check to use >= rather == to ensure that migration works
    correctly when the ESPState VMStateDescription has version_id > 5.
