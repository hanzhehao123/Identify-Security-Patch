    block/vvfat: inherit child_vvfat_qcow from child_of_bds
    
    Recently we've fixed a crash by adding .get_parent_aio_context handler
    to child_vvfat_qcow. Now we want it to support .get_parent_desc as
    well. child_vvfat_qcow wants to implement own .inherit_options, it's
    not bad. But omitting all other handlers is a bad idea. Let's inherit
    the class from child_of_bds instead, similar to chain_child_class and
    detach_by_driver_cb_class in test-bdrv-drain.c.
