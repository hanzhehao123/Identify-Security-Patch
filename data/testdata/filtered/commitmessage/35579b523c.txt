    esp: revert 75ef849696 "esp: correctly fill bus id with requested lun"
    
    This commit from nearly 10 years ago is now broken due to the improvements
    in esp emulation (or perhaps was never correct).  It shows up as a bug
    in detecting the CDROM drive under MacOS. The error is caused by the
    MacOS CDROM driver sending this CDB with an "S without ATN" command and
    without DMA:
    
        0x12 0x00 0x00 0x00 0x05 0x00 (INQUIRY)
    
    This is a valid INQUIRY command, however with this logic present the 3rd
    byte (0x0) is copied over the 1st byte (0x12) which silently converts the
    INQUIRY command to a TEST UNIT READY command before passing it to the
    QEMU SCSI layer.  Since the TEST UNIT READY command has a zero length
    response the MacOS CDROM driver never receives a response and assumes
    the CDROM is not present.
    
    The logic was to ignore the IDENTIFY byte and copy the LUN over from
    the CDB, which did store the LUN in bits 5-7 of the second byte in
    olden times.  This however is all obsolete, so just drop the code.
