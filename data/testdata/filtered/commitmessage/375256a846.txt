    target/arm: Handle VPR semantics in existing code
    
    When MVE is supported, the VPR register has a place on the exception
    stack frame in a previously reserved slot just above the FPSCR.
    It must also be zeroed in various situations when we invalidate
    FPU context.
    
    Update the code which handles the stack frames (exception entry and
    exit code, VLLDM, and VLSTM) to save/restore VPR.
    
    Update code which invalidates FP registers (mostly also exception
    entry and exit code, but also VSCCLRM and the code in
    full_vfp_access_check() that corresponds to the ExecuteFPCheck()
    pseudocode) to zero VPR.
