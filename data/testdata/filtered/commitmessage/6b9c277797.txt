    gitlab: add python linters to CI
    
    Add a Python container that has just enough juice for us to run the
    Python code quality analysis tools. Base this container on Fedora,
    because Fedora has very convenient packaging for testing multiple Python
    versions.
    
    We need python3, pip (for pulling packages), pipenv and virtualenv for
    creating virtual environments, and tox for running tests. make is needed
    for running 'make check-tox' and 'make venv-check' targets. Python3.10
    is needed explicitly because the tox package only pulls in 3.6-3.9, but
    we wish to test the forthcoming release of Python as well to help
    predict any problems. Lastly, we need gcc to compile PyPI packages that
    may not have a binary distribution available.
    
    Add two tests:
    
    check-python-pipenv uses pipenv to test a frozen, very explicit set of
    packages against our minimum supported python version, Python 3.6. This
    test is not allowed to fail. The dependencies this test uses do not
    change unless python/Pipfile.lock is changed.
    
    check-python-tox uses tox to install the latest versions of required
    python dependencies against a wide array of Python versions from 3.6 to
    3.9, even including the yet-to-be-released Python 3.10. This test is
    allowed to fail with a warning.
