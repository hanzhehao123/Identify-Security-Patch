    block: improve permission conflict error message
    
    Now permissions are updated as follows:
     1. do graph modifications ignoring permissions
     2. do permission update
    
     (of course, we rollback [1] if [2] fails)
    
    So, on stage [2] we can't say which users are "old" and which are
    "new" and exist only since [1]. And current error message is a bit
    outdated. Let's improve it, to make everything clean.
    
    While being here, add also a comment and some good assertions.
    
    iotests 283, 307, qsd-jobs outputs are updated.
