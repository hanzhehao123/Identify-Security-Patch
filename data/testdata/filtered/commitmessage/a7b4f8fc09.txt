    progressmeter: protect with a mutex
    
    Progressmeter is protected by the AioContext mutex, which
    is taken by the block jobs and their caller (like blockdev).
    
    We would like to remove the dependency of block layer code on the
    AioContext mutex, since most drivers and the core I/O code are already
    not relying on it.
    
    Create a new C file to implement the ProgressMeter API, but keep the
    struct as public, to avoid forcing allocation on the heap.
    
    Also add a mutex to be able to provide an accurate snapshot of the
    progress values to the caller.
