    python/machine: Disable pylint warning for open() in _pre_launch
    
    Shift the open() call later so that the pylint pragma applies *only* to
    that one open() call. Add a note that suggests why this is safe: the
    resource is unconditionally cleaned up in _post_shutdown().
    
    _post_shutdown is called after failed launches (see launch()), and
    unconditionally after every call to shutdown(), and therefore also on
    __exit__.
