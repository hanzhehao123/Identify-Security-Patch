    machine: move common smp_parse code to caller
    
    Most of smp_parse and pc_smp_parse is guarded by an "if (opts)"
    conditional, and the rest is common to both function.  Move the
    conditional and the common code to the caller, machine_smp_parse.
    
    Move the replay_add_blocker call after all errors are checked for.
