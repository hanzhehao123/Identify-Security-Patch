commit 1e129afc311a4a3897e83a308cce79e2c1cc3d89
Author: John Snow <jsnow@redhat.com>

    scripts/qemu-ga-client: move to python/qemu/qmp/qemu_ga_client.py
    
    The script itself will be unavailable for a few commits before being
    restored, with no way to run it right after this commit. This helps move
    git history into the new file. To prevent linter regressions, though, we
    do need to immediately touch up the filename to remove dashes (to make
    the module importable), and remove the executable bit.
