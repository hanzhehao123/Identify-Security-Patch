    target/mips: Remove microMIPS BPOSGE32 / BPOSGE64 unuseful cases
    
    These switch cases for the microMIPS BPOSGE32 / BPOSGE64 opcodes have
    been added commit 3c824109da0 ("target-mips: microMIPS ASE support").
    More than 11 years later it is safe to assume there won't be added
    soon. The cases fall back to the default which generates a RESERVED
    INSTRUCTION, so it is safe to remove them.
    Functionally speaking, the patch is a no-op.
