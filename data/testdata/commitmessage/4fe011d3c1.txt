    target/ppc: remove ppc_cpu_dump_statistics
    
    This function requires surce code modification to be useful, which means
    it probably is not used often, and the move to using decodetree means
    the statistics won't even be collected anymore.
    
    Also removed setting dump_statistics in ppc_cpu_realize, since it was
    only useful when in conjunction with ppc_cpu_dump_statistics.
