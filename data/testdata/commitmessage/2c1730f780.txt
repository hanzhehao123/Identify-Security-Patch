    docs/interop/live-block-operations: Do not hard-code the QEMU binary name
    
    In downstream, we want to use a different name for the QEMU binary,
    and some people might also use the docs for non-x86 binaries, that's
    why we already created the |qemu_system| placeholder in the past.
    Use it now in the live-block-operations doc, too.
