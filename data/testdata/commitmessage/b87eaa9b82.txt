    memory: Introduce log_sync_global() to memory listener
    
    Some of the memory listener may want to do log synchronization without
    being able to specify a range of memory to sync but always globally.
    Such a memory listener should provide this new method instead of the
    log_sync() method.
    
    Obviously we can also achieve similar thing when we put the global
    sync logic into a log_sync() handler. However that's not efficient
    enough because otherwise memory_global_dirty_log_sync() may do the
    global sync N times, where N is the number of flat ranges in the
    address space.
    
    Make this new method be exclusive to log_sync().
