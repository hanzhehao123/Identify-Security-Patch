    hvf: Move hvf internal definitions into common header
    
    Until now, Hypervisor.framework has only been available on x86_64 systems.
    With Apple Silicon shipping now, it extends its reach to aarch64. To
    prepare for support for multiple architectures, let's start moving common
    code out into its own accel directory.
    
    This patch moves a few internal struct and constant defines over.
