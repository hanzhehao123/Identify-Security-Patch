    docs: fix references to docs/devel/tracing.rst
    
    Commit e50caf4a5c ("tracing: convert documentation to rST")
    converted docs/devel/tracing.txt to docs/devel/tracing.rst.
    
    We still have several references to the old file, so let's fix them
    with the following command:
    
      sed -i s/tracing.txt/tracing.rst/ $(git grep -l docs/devel/tracing.txt)
