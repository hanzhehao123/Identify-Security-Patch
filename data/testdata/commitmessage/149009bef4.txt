    block-copy: atomic .cancelled and .finished fields in BlockCopyCallState
    
    By adding acquire/release pairs, we ensure that .ret and .error_is_read
    fields are written by block_copy_dirty_clusters before .finished is true,
    and that they are read by API user after .finished is true.
    
    The atomic here are necessary because the fields are concurrently modified
    in coroutines, and read outside.
