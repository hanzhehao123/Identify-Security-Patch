    block/quorum: Provide .bdrv_co_flush instead of .bdrv_co_flush_to_disk
    
    The quorum block driver uses a custom flush callback to handle the
    case when some children return io errors. In that case it still
    returns success if enough children are healthy.
    However, it provides it as the .bdrv_co_flush_to_disk callback, not
    as .bdrv_co_flush. This causes the block layer to do it's own
    generic flushing for the children instead, which doesn't handle
    errors properly.
    
    Fix this by providing .bdrv_co_flush instead of
    .bdrv_co_flush_to_disk so the block layer uses the custom flush
    callback.
