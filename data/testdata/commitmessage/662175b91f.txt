    i386: reorder call to cpu_exec_realizefn
    
    i386 realizefn code is sensitive to ordering, and recent commits
    aimed at refactoring it, splitting accelerator-specific code,
    broke assumptions which need to be fixed.
    
    We need to:
    
    * process hyper-v enlightements first, as they assume features
      not to be expanded
    
    * only then, expand features
    
    * after expanding features, attempt to check them and modify them in the
      accel-specific realizefn code called by cpu_exec_realizefn().
    
    * after the framework has been called via cpu_exec_realizefn,
      the code can check for what has or hasn't been set by accel-specific
      code, or extend its results, ie:
    
      - check and evenually set code_urev default
      - modify cpu->mwait after potentially being set from host CPUID.
      - finally check for phys_bits assuming all user and accel-specific
        adjustments have already been taken into account.
