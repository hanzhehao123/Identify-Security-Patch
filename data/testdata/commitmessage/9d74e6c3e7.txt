    pckbd: clear outport_present in outer pre_load()
    
    The variable outport_present is a flag to show if the outport
    subsection was loaded. Clear the outport_present flag in the
    outer pre_load() function. This method is recommended in the QEMU
    manual for developers in the chapter "Migration, Subsections".
