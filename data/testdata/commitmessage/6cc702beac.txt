    block/nbd: call socket_address_parse_named_fd() in advance
    
    Detecting monitor by current coroutine works bad when we are not in
    coroutine context. And that's exactly so in nbd reconnect code, where
    qio_channel_socket_connect_sync() is called from thread.
    
    Monitor is needed only to parse named file descriptor. So, let's just
    parse it during nbd_open(), so that all further users of s->saddr don't
    need to access monitor.
