    scripts/qmp-shell: Use context manager instead of atexit
    
    We can invoke the shell history writing when we leave the QMPShell scope
    instead of relying on atexit. Doing so may be preferable to avoid global
    state being registered from within a class instead of from the
    application logic directly.
    
    Use QMP's context manager to hook this history saving at close time,
    which gets invoked when we leave the context block.
