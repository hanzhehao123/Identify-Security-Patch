    crypto: bump min gnutls to 3.5.18, dropping RHEL-7 support
    
    It has been over two years since RHEL-8 was released, and thus per the
    platform build policy, we no longer need to support RHEL-7 as a build
    target. This lets us increment the minimum required gnutls version
    
    Per repology, current shipping versions are:
    
                 RHEL-8: 3.6.14
          Debian Buster: 3.6.7
     openSUSE Leap 15.2: 3.6.7
       Ubuntu LTS 18.04: 3.5.18
       Ubuntu LTS 20.04: 3.6.13
                FreeBSD: 3.6.15
              Fedora 33: 3.6.16
              Fedora 34: 3.7.1
                OpenBSD: 3.6.15
         macOS HomeBrew: 3.6.15
    
    Ubuntu LTS 18.04 has the oldest version and so 3.5.18 is the new minimum.
