    Acceptance Tests: introduce CPU hotplug test
    
    Even though there are qtest based tests for hotplugging CPUs (from
    which this test took some inspiration from), this one adds checks
    from a Linux guest point of view.
    
    It should also serve as an example for tests that follow a similar
    pattern and need to interact with QEMU (via qmp) and with the Linux
    guest via SSH.
