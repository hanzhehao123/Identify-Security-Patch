    hw/alpha: Set minimum PCI device ID to 1 to match Clipper IRQ mappings
    
    Since we are emulating a Clipper device topology, we need to set the
    minimum PCI device ID to 1, as there is no IRQ mapping for a device
    at ID 0 (see sys_dp264.c:clipper_map_irq()).
    
    - Add a 'devfn_min' argument to typhoon_init().  Pass that argument
      along to pci_register_root_bus().
    - In clipper_init(), pass PCI_DEVFN(1, 0) as the minimum PCI device
      ID/function.
