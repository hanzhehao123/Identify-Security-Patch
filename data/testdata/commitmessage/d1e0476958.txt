    python: add pylint import exceptions
    
    Pylint 2.5.x - 2.7.x have regressions that make import checking
    inconsistent, see:
    
    https://github.com/PyCQA/pylint/issues/3609
    https://github.com/PyCQA/pylint/issues/3624
    https://github.com/PyCQA/pylint/issues/3651
    
    Pinning to 2.4.4 is worse, because it mandates versions of shared
    dependencies that are too old for features we want in isort and mypy.
    Oh well.
