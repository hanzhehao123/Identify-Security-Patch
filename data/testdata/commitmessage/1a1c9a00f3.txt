    target/ppc: removed all mentions to PPC_DUMP_CPU
    
    This feature will no longer be useful as ppc moves to using decodetree
    for TCG. And building with it enabled is no longer possible, due to
    changes in opc_handler_t. Since the last commit that mentions it
    happened in 2014, I think it is safe to remove it.
