    configure: Check whether we can compile the s390-ccw bios with -msoft-float
    
    The -msoft-float switch is not available in older versions of Clang.
    Since we rely on the compiler to not generate floating point instructions
    unexpectedly, we block those old compilers now via a test in the configure
    script. Note that for some weird reasons, the Clang compiler only complains
    about the missing soft-float support if no other flags are passed via
    "-Wl,..." to the linker. So we have to use "compile_object" instead of
    "compile_prog" for this check.
