    pckbd: correctly disable PS/2 communication
    
    Currently the PS/2 controller command KBD_CCMD_MOUSE_DISABLE
    doesn't disable the PS/2 mouse communication at all, and the
    PS/2 controller commands KBD_CCMD_KBD_DISABLE and
    KBD_CCMD_KBD_ENABLE only disable and enable the keyboard
    interrupt, which is very different from what a real PS/2
    controller does. A guest may notice the difference.
    
    Mask out pending data on disabled queues to correctly disable
    the PS/2 controller communication.
