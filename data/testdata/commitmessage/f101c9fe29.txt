    tests/tcg: skip the signals test for hppa/s390x for now
    
    There are fixes currently in flight but as this is getting in the way
    of a green CI we might as well skip for now. For reference the fix
    series are:
    
      linux-user: Move signal trampolines to new page
      20210616011209.1446045-1-richard.henderson@linaro.org
    
    and
    
      linux-user: Load a vdso for x86_64 and hppa
