    tcg: Move in_code_gen_buffer and tests to region.c
    
    Shortly, the full code_gen_buffer will only be visible
    to region.c, so move in_code_gen_buffer out-of-line.
    
    Move the debugging versions of tcg_splitwx_to_{rx,rw}
    to region.c as well, so that the compiler gets to see
    the implementation of in_code_gen_buffer.
    
    This leaves exactly one use of in_code_gen_buffer outside
    of region.c, in cpu_restore_state.  Which, being on the
    exception path, is not performance critical.
