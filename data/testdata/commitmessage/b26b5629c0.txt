    target/arm: Make FPSCR.LTPSIZE writable for MVE
    
    The M-profile FPSCR has an LTPSIZE field, but if MVE is not
    implemented it is read-only and always reads as 4; this is how QEMU
    currently handles it.
    
    Make the field writable when MVE is implemented.
    
    We can safely add the field to the MVE migration struct because
    currently no CPUs enable MVE and so the migration struct is never
    used.
