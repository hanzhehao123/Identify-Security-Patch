    input: Add lang1 and lang2 to QKeyCode
    
    lang1 and lang2 represents the keys with the same names in the
    keyboard/keypad usage page (0x07) included in the "HID Usage Tables for
    Universal Serial Bus (USB)" version 1.22. Although the keys are
    described as "Hangul/English toggle key" and "Hanja conversion key" in
    the specification, the meaning depends on the variety of the keyboard,
    and it will be used as the representations of Kana and Eisu keys on
    Japanese Macs in qemu_input_map_osx_to_qcode, which is used by ui/gtk.
