    softfloat: Move sqrt_float to softfloat-parts.c.inc
    
    Rename to parts$N_sqrt.
    Reimplement float128_sqrt with FloatParts128.
    
    Reimplement with the inverse sqrt newton-raphson algorithm from musl.
    This is significantly faster than even the berkeley sqrt n-r algorithm,
    because it does not use division instructions, only multiplication.
    
    Ordinarily, changing algorithms at the same time as migrating code is
    a bad idea, but this is the only way I found that didn't break one of
    the routines at the same time.
