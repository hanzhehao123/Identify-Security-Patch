    block/nbd: ensure ->connection_thread is always valid
    
    Simplify lifetime management of BDRVNBDState->connect_thread by
    delaying the possible cleanup of it until the BDRVNBDState itself goes
    away.
    
    This also reverts
     0267101af6 "block/nbd: fix possible use after free of s->connect_thread"
    as now s->connect_thread can't be cleared until the very end.
