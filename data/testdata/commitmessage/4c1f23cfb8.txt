    tests: remove QCRYPTO_HAVE_TLS_TEST_SUPPORT
    
    meson.build already decides whether it is possible to build the TLS
    test suite.  There is no need to include that in the source as well.
    The dummy tests in fact are broken because they do not produce valid
    TAP output (empty output is rejected by scripts/tap-driver.pl).
