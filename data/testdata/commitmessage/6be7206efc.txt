    scripts/qmp-shell: move to python/qemu/qmp/qmp_shell.py
    
    The script will be unavailable for a commit or two, which will help
    preserve development history attached to the new file. A forwarder will
    be added shortly afterwards.
    
    With qmp_shell in the python qemu.qmp package, now it is fully type
    checked, linted, etc. via the Python CI. It will be quite a bit harder
    to accidentally break it again in the future.
