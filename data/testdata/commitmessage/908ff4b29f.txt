    scripts/qmp: redirect qom-xxx scripts to python/qemu/qmp/
    
    Redirect to the new qom scripts. These forwarders can be deleted
    eventually when there has been more time for the dust on the Python
    packaging to settle and people understand how to find these commands.
    
    Note: You can run these by setting $PYTHONPATH in your shell and then
    running "python3 -m qemu.qmp.qom", or you can install the qemu namespace
    package and use the "qom" or "qom-set" scripts.
    
    I've written how to install the package elsewhere, but for the sake of
    git-blame, cd to ./python, and then do:
    
    - pip3 install [--user] [-e] .
    
    --user will install to your local user install (will not work inside of
      a venv), omitting this flag installs to your system-wide packages
      (outside of a venv) or to your current virtual environment (inside the
      venv).
    
      When installing to a venv or to your system-wide packages, "qom"
      should be in your $PATH already. If you do a user install, you may
      need to add ~/.local/bin to your $PATH if you haven't already.
    
    -e installs in editable mode: the installed package is effectively just
     a symlink to this folder; so changes to your git working tree are
     reflected in the installed package.
    
    Note: installing these packages to an environment outside a venv can be
    dangerous: Many QEMU scripts will begin to prefer the installed version
    instead of the version directly in the tree. Use with caution. editable
    mode is recommended when working outside of a venv.
