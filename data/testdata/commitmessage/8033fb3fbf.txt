    target/ppc: created tcg-stub.c file
    
    Created a file with stubs needed to compile disabling TCG. *_ppc_opcodes
    were created to make cpu_init.c have a few less ifdefs, since they are
    not needed. softmmu_resize_hpt_* have to be created because the compiler
    can't automatically know they aren't used, but they should never be
    reached.
