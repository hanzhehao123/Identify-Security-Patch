    vl: plug -object back into -readconfig
    
    Commit bc2f4fcb1d ("qom: move user_creatable_add_opts logic to vl.c
    and QAPIfy it", 2021-03-19) switched the creation of objects from
    qemu_opts_foreach to a bespoke QTAILQ in preparation for supporting JSON
    syntax in -object.
    
    Unfortunately in doing so it lost support for [object] stanzas in
    configuration files and also for "-set object.ID.KEY=VAL".  The latter
    is hard to re-establish and probably best solved by deprecating -set.
    This patch uses the infrastructure introduced by the previous two
    patches in order to parse QOM objects correctly from configuration
    files.
