    tests/tcg: add a multiarch signals test to stress test signal delivery
    
    This adds a simple signal test that combines the POSIX timer_create
    with signal delivery across multiple threads. The aim is to provide a
    bit more of a stress test to flush out signal handling issues for
    easily than the occasional random crash we sometimes see in linux-test
    or threadcount.
