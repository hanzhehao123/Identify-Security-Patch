    Hexagon (target/hexagon) fix l2fetch instructions
    
    Y4_l2fetch == l2fetch(Rs32, Rt32)
    Y5_l2fetch == l2fetch(Rs32, Rtt32)
    
    The semantics for these instructions are present, but the encodings
    are missing.
    
    Note that these are treated as nops in qemu, so we add overrides.
    
    Test case added to tests/tcg/hexagon/misc.c
