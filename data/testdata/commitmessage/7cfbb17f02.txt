    hw/riscv: Support the official CLINT DT bindings
    
    Linux kernel commit a2770b57d083 ("dt-bindings: timer: Add CLINT bindings")
    adds the official DT bindings for CLINT, which uses "sifive,clint0"
    as the compatible string. "riscv,clint0" is now legacy and has to
    be kept for backward compatibility of legacy systems.
