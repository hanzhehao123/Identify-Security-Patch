    target/ppc: powerpc_excp: Consolidade TLB miss code
    
    The only difference in the code for Instruction fetch, Data load and
    Data store TLB miss errors is that when called from an unsupported
    processor (i.e. not one of 602, 603, 603e, G2, 7x5 or 74xx), they
    abort with a message specific to the operation type (insn fetch, data
    load/store).
    
    If a processor does not support those interrupts we should not be
    registering them in init_excp_<proc> to begin with, so that error
    message would never be used.
    
    I'm leaving the message in for completeness, but making it generic and
    consolidating the three interrupts into the same case statement body.
