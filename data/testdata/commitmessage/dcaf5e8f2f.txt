    gitlab: Drop linux user build job for CentOS 7
    
    It has been over two years since RHEL-8 was released, and thus per the
    platform build policy, we no longer need to support RHEL-7 as a build
    target.
    
    The build-user-centos7 job was to detect a failure specific to CentOS
    7 and there are already other linux user jobs for other platforms.
    Thus we can drop this job rather than move it to CentOS 8.
