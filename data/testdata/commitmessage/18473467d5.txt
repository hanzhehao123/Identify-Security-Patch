    file-posix: try BLKSECTGET on block devices too, do not round to power of 2
    
    bs->sg is only true for character devices, but block devices can also
    be used with scsi-block and scsi-generic.  Unfortunately BLKSECTGET
    returns bytes in an int for /dev/sgN devices, and sectors in a short
    for block devices, so account for that in the code.
    
    The maximum transfer also need not be a power of 2 (for example I have
    seen disks with 1280 KiB maximum transfer) so there's no need to pass
    the result through pow2floor.
