    virtiofsd: Simplify skip byte logic
    
    We need to skip bytes in two cases.
    
    a. Before we start reading into in_sg, we need to skip iov_len bytes
       in the beginning which typically will have fuse_out_header.
    
    b. If preadv() does a short read, then we need to retry preadv() with
       remainig bytes and skip the bytes preadv() read in short read.
    
    For case a, there is no reason that skipping logic be inside the while
    loop. Move it outside. And only retain logic "b" inside while loop.
    
    Also get rid of variable "skip_size". Looks like we can do without it.
