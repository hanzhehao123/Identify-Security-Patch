    tcg/tci: Emit setcond before brcond
    
    The encoding planned for tci does not have enough room for
    brcond2, with 4 registers and a condition as input as well
    as the label.  Resolve the condition into TCG_REG_TMP, and
    relax brcond to one register plus a label, considering the
    condition to always be reg != 0.
