    Acceptance Tests: move useful ssh methods to base class
    
    Both the virtiofs submounts and the linux ssh mips malta tests
    contains useful methods related to ssh that deserve to be made
    available to other tests.  Let's move them to an auxiliary, mix-in
    class that will be used on the base LinuxTest class.
    
    The method that helps with setting up an ssh connection will now
    support both key and password based authentication, defaulting to key
    based.
