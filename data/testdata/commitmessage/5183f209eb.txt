    Revert "tcg/tci: Use exec/cpu_ldst.h interfaces"
    
    This reverts commit dc09f047eddec8f4a1991c4f5f4a428d7aa3f2c0.
    
    For tcg, tracepoints are expanded inline in tcg opcodes.
    Using a helper which generates a second tracepoint is incorrect.
    
    For system mode, the extraction and re-packing of MemOp and mmu_idx
    lost the alignment information from MemOp.  So we were no longer
    raising alignment exceptions for !TARGET_ALIGNED_ONLY guests.
    This can be seen in tests/tcg/xtensa/test_load_store.S.
    
    For user mode, we must update to the new signature of g2h() so that
    the revert compiles.  We can leave set_helper_retaddr for later.
