    configure: check for submodules if --with-git-submodules=ignore
    
    Right now --with-git-submodules=ignore has a subtle difference from
    just running without a .git directory, in that it does not check
    that submodule sources actually exist.  Move the check for
    ui/keycodemapdb/README so that it happens even if the user
    specified --with-git-submodules=ignore, with a customized
    error message that is more suitable for this situation.
