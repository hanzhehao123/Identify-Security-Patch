    tcg/aarch64: Fix tcg_out_rotl
    
    The last argument of tcg_out_extr() must be in the range 0-31 if ext==0.
    Before the fix, when m==0 it becomes 32 and it crashes with an Illegal
    instruction on Apple Silicon.  After the fix, it will be 0.  If m is in
    the range 1-31, it is the same as before.
