    scripts/qemu-ga-client: apply (most) pylint rules
    
    I'm only doing a very quick best-effort to preserve this script, to help
    keep it from breaking further. I think there are pending ideas swirling
    on the right way to implement better SDKs and better clients, and this
    script might be a handy reference for those discussions. It presents
    some interesting design problems, like static type safety when using a
    dynamic RPC mechanism.
    
    I believe it's worth preserving the effort and care that went into
    making this script by updating it to work with our current
    infrastructure. However, I am disabling the requirement for docstrings
    in this file.
    
    If you would like to help improve this script, please add docstrings
    alongside any refactors or rejuvenations you might apply at that time.
