    python: add VERSION file
    
    Python infrastructure as it exists today is not capable reliably of
    single-sourcing a package version from a parent directory. The authors
    of pip are working to correct this, but as of today this is not possible.
    
    The problem is that when using pip to build and install a python
    package, it copies files over to a temporary directory and performs its
    build there. This loses access to any information in the parent
    directory, including git itself.
    
    Further, Python versions have a standard (PEP 440) that may or may not
    follow QEMU's versioning. In general, it does; but naturally QEMU does
    not follow PEP 440. To avoid any automatically-generated conflict, a
    manual version file is preferred.
    
    I am proposing:
    
    - Python tooling follows the QEMU version, indirectly, but with a major
      version of 0 to indicate that the API is not expected to be
      stable. This would mean version 0.5.2.0, 0.5.1.1, 0.5.3.0, etc.
    
    - In the event that a Python package needs to be updated independently
      of the QEMU version, a pre-release alpha version should be preferred,
      but *only* after inclusion to the qemu development or stable branches.
    
      e.g. 0.5.2.0a1, 0.5.2.0a2, and so on should be preferred prior to
      5.2.0's release.
    
    - The Python core tooling makes absolutely no version compatibility
      checks or constraints. It *may* work with releases of QEMU from the
      past or future, but it is not required to.
    
      i.e., "qemu.machine" will, for now, remain in lock-step with QEMU.
    
    - We reserve the right to split the qemu package into independently
      versioned subpackages at a later date. This might allow for us to
      begin versioning QMP independently from QEMU at a later date, if
      we so choose.
    
    Implement this versioning scheme by adding a VERSION file and setting it
    to 0.6.0.0a1.
