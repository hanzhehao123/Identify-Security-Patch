    block-backend: align max_transfer to request alignment
    
    Block device requests must be aligned to bs->bl.request_alignment.
    It makes sense for drivers to align bs->bl.max_transfer the same
    way; however when there is no specified limit, blk_get_max_transfer
    just returns INT_MAX.  Since the contract of the function does not
    specify that INT_MAX means "no maximum", just align the outcome
    of the function (whether INT_MAX or bs->bl.max_transfer) before
    returning it.
