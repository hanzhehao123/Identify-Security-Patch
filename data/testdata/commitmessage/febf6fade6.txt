    linux-user: Fix incorrect use of feature-test-macros
    
    The _POSIX_C_SOURCE and _XOPEN_SOURCE macros are used by the
    application to indicate to libc which declarations it should expose.
    Since qemu does not define them anywhere, it does not make sense
    to check their value.
    
    Instead, since the intent is to determine whether the host struct
    stat supports the st_*tim fields, use the configure test result
    which does exactly that.
