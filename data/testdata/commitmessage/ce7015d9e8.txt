    hw/display/qxl: Set pci rom address aligned with page size
    
    On some MIPS system, page size is 16K, and qxl vga device can
    be used for VM in kvm mode. Qxl pci rom size is set 8K fixed,
    smaller than 16K page size on host system, it fails to be
    added into memslots in kvm mode where memory_size and GPA
    are required to align with page size.
    
    This patch fixes this issue.
