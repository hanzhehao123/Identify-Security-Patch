    replay: fix watchpoint processing for reverse debugging
    
    This patch enables reverse debugging with watchpoints.
    Reverse continue scans the execution to find the breakpoints
    and watchpoints that should fire. It uses helper function
    replay_breakpoint() for that. But this function needs to access
    icount, which can't be correct in the middle of TB.
    Therefore, in case of watchpoint, we have to retranslate the block
    to allow this access.
