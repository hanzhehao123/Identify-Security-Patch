    tests/qtest/bios-tables-test: Check for dup2() failure
    
    Coverity notes that we don't check for dup2() failing.  Add some
    assertions so that if it does ever happen we get some indication.
    (This is similar to how we handle other "don't expect this syscall to
    fail" checks in this test code.)
