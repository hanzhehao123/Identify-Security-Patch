    nbd/client-connection: shutdown connection on release
    
    Now, when a thread can do negotiation and retry, it may run relatively
    long. We need a mechanism to stop it, when the user is not interested
    in a result any more. So, on nbd_client_connection_release() let's
    shutdown the socket, and do not retry connection if thread is detached.
