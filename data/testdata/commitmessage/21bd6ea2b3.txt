    s390x/tcg: Simplify vop64_2() handling
    
    Let's rework our macros and simplify. We still need helper functions in
    most cases due to the different parameters types.
    
    Next, we'll only have 32/128bit variants for vfi and vfsq, so special
    case the others.
    
    Note that for vfsq, the XxC and erm passed in the simd_data() will never be
    set, resulting in the same behavior.
