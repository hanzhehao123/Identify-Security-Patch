    hvf: Move assert_hvf_ok() into common directory
    
    Until now, Hypervisor.framework has only been available on x86_64 systems.
    With Apple Silicon shipping now, it extends its reach to aarch64. To
    prepare for support for multiple architectures, let's start moving common
    code out into its own accel directory.
    
    This patch moves assert_hvf_ok() and introduces generic build infrastructure.
