    target/i386: tcg: fix switching from 16-bit to 32-bit tasks or vice versa
    
    The format of the task state segment is governed by bit 3 in the
    descriptor type field.  On a task switch, the format for saving
    is given by the current value of TR's type field, while the
    format for loading is given by the new descriptor.
