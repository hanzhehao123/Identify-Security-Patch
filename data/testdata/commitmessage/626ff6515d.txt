    migration: add trace point when vm_stop_force_state fails
    
    This is a critical failure scenario for migration that is hard to
    diagnose from existing probes. Most likely it is caused by an error
    from bdrv_flush(), but we're not logging the errno anywhere, hence
    this new probe.
