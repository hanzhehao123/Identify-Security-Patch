    i386: use better matching family/model/stepping for 'max' CPU
    
    The 'max' CPU under TCG currently reports a family/model/stepping that
    approximately corresponds to an AMD K7 vintage architecture.
    The K7 series predates the introduction of 64-bit support by AMD
    in the K8 series. This has been reported to lead to LLVM complaints
    about generating 64-bit code for a 32-bit CPU target
    
      LLVM ERROR: 64-bit code requested on a subtarget that doesn't support it!
    
    It appears LLVM looks at the family/model/stepping, despite qemu64
    reporting it is 64-bit capable.
    
    This patch changes 'max' to report a CPUID with the family, model
    and stepping taken from a
    
     AMD Athlon(tm) 64 X2 Dual Core Processor 4000+
    
    which is one of the first 64-bit AMD CPUs.
