    target/arm: Provide and use H8 and H1_8 macros
    
    Currently we provide Hn and H1_n macros for accessing the correct
    data within arrays of vector elements of size 1, 2 and 4, accounting
    for host endianness.  We don't provide any macros for elements of
    size 8 because there the host endianness doesn't matter.  However,
    this does result in awkwardness where we need to pass empty arguments
    to macros, because checkpatch complains about them.  The empty
    argument is a little confusing for humans to read as well.
    
    Add H8() and H1_8() macros and use them where we were previously
    passing empty arguments to macros.
