    target/mips: Restrict some system specific declarations to sysemu
    
    Commit 043715d1e0f ("target/mips: Update ITU to utilize SAARI
    and SAAR CP0 registers") declared itc_reconfigure() in public
    namespace, while it is restricted to system emulation.
    
    Similarly commit 5679479b9a1 ("target/mips: Move CP0 helpers
    to sysemu/cp0.c") restricted cpu_mips_soft_irq() definition to
    system emulation, but forgot to restrict its declaration.
    
    To avoid polluting user-mode emulation with these declarations,
    restrict them to sysemu. Also restrict the sysemu ITU/ITC/IRQ
    fields from CPUMIPSState.
