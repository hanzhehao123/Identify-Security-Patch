    tests/acceptance: tweak the tcg/kvm tests for virt
    
    Really it's only TCG that can select which GIC model you want, KVM
    guests should always be using the "host" version of the GIC for which
    QEMU already provides a handy shortcut. Make the KVM test use this and
    split the TCG test into it's two versions.
