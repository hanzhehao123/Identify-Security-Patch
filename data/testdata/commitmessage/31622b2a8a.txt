    python: add avocado-framework and tests
    
    Try using avocado to manage our various tests; even though right now
    they're only invoking shell scripts and not really running any
    python-native code.
    
    Create tests/, and add shell scripts which call out to mypy, flake8,
    pylint and isort to enforce the standards in this directory.
    
    Add avocado-framework to the setup.cfg development dependencies, and add
    avocado.cfg to store some preferences for how we'd like the test output
    to look.
    
    Finally, add avocado-framework to the Pipfile environment and lock the
    new dependencies. We are using avocado >= 87.0 here to take advantage of
    some features that Cleber has helpfully added to make the test output
    here *very* friendly and easy to read for developers that might chance
    upon the output in Gitlab CI.
    
    [Note: ALL of the dependencies get updated to the most modern versions
    that exist at the time of this writing. No way around it that I have
    seen. Not ideal, but so it goes.]
    
    Provided you have the right development dependencies (mypy, flake8,
    isort, pylint, and now avocado-framework) You should be able to run
    "avocado --config avocado.cfg run tests/" from the python folder to run
    all of these linters with the correct arguments.
    
    (A forthcoming commit adds the much easier 'make check'.)
