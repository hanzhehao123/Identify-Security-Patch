    target/arm: fix missing exception class
    
    The DAIF and PAC checks used raise_exception_ra to raise an exception
    and unwind CPU state but raise_exception_ra is currently designed for
    handling data aborts as the syndrome is partially precomputed and
    encoded in the TB and then merged in merge_syn_data_abort when handling
    the data abort.  Using raise_exception_ra for DAIF and PAC checks
    results in an empty syndrome being retrieved from data[2] in
    restore_state_to_opc and setting ESR to 0.  This manifested as:
    
      kvm [571]: Unknown exception class: esr: 0x000000 â€“
      Unknown/Uncategorized
    
    when launching a KVM guest when the host qemu used a CPU supporting
    EL2+pointer authentication and enabling pointer authentication in the
    guest.
    
    Rework raise_exception_ra such that the state is restored before raising
    the exception so that the exception is not clobbered by
    restore_state_to_opc.
