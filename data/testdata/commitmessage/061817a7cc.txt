    i386: drop FEAT_HYPERV feature leaves
    
    Hyper-V feature leaves are weird. We have some of them in
    feature_word_info[] array but we don't use feature_word_info
    magic to enable them. Neither do we use feature_dependencies[]
    mechanism to validate the configuration as it doesn't allign
    well with Hyper-V's many-to-many dependency chains. Some of
    the feature leaves hold not only feature bits, but also values.
    E.g. FEAT_HV_NESTED_EAX contains both features and the supported
    Enlightened VMCS range.
    
    Hyper-V features are already represented in 'struct X86CPU' with
    uint64_t hyperv_features so duplicating them in env->features adds
    little (or zero) benefits. THe other half of Hyper-V emulation features
    is also stored with values in hyperv_vendor_id[], hyperv_limits[],...
    so env->features[] is already incomplete.
    
    Remove Hyper-V feature leaves from env->features[] completely.
    kvm_hyperv_properties[] is converted to using raw CPUID func/reg
    pairs for features, this allows us to get rid of hv_cpuid_get_fw()
    conversion.
