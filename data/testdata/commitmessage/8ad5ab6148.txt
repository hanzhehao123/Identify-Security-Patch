    file-posix: fix max_iov for /dev/sg devices
    
    Even though it was only called for devices that have bs->sg set (which
    must be character devices), sg_get_max_segments looked at /sys/dev/block
    which only works for block devices.
    
    On Linux the sg driver has its own way to provide the maximum number of
    iovecs in a scatter/gather list, so add support for it.  The block device
    path is kept because it will be reinstated in the next patches.
