    tests/qtest/tpm-tests: Remove unnecessary NULL checks
    
    Coverity points out that in tpm_test_swtpm_migration_test() we
    assume that src_tpm_addr and dst_tpm_addr are non-NULL (we
    pass them to tpm_util_migration_start_qemu() which will
    unconditionally dereference them) but then later explicitly
    check them for NULL. Remove the pointless checks.
    
    Fixes: Coverity CID 1432367, 1432359
