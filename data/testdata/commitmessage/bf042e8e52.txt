    tcg: Split out tcg_region_prologue_set
    
    This has only one user, but will make more sense after some
    code motion.
    
    Always leave the tcg_init_ctx initialized to the first region,
    in preparation for tcg_prologue_init().  This also requires
    that we don't re-allocate the region for the first cpu, lest
    we hit the assertion for total number of regions allocated .
