    tcg/tci: Use {set,clear}_helper_retaddr
    
    Wrap guest memory operations for tci like we do for cpu_ld*_data.
    
    We cannot actually use the cpu_ldst.h interface without duplicating
    the memory trace operations performed within, which will already
    have been expanded into the tcg opcode stream.
