    Python: expose QEMUMachine's temporary directory
    
    Each instance of qemu.machine.QEMUMachine currently has a "test
    directory", which may not have any relation to a "test", and it's
    really a temporary directory.
    
    Users instantiating the QEMUMachine class will be able to set the
    location of the directory that will *contain* the QEMUMachine unique
    temporary directory, so that parameter name has been changed from
    test_dir to base_temp_dir.
    
    A property has been added to allow users to access it without using
    private attributes, and with that, the directory is created on first
    use of the property.
