    hw/alpha: Provide a PCI-ISA bridge device node
    
    - Move initialization of the ISA bus from typhoon_init() to clipper_init();
      this apsect of device topology is really associated with the individual
      model, not the core logic chipset.  typhoon_init() now returns the IRQ
      to use for the output of the ISA PIC.
    
    - In clipper_init(), instantiate an i82378 instance, and connect its
      PIC output to the ISA IRQ input provided by typhoon_init().  Remove
      the explicit instantiations of i8254 and i82374, as these devices
      are subsumed by the i82378.
