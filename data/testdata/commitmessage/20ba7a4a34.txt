    crypto: bump min nettle to 3.4, dropping RHEL-7 support
    
    It has been over two years since RHEL-8 was released, and thus per the
    platform build policy, we no longer need to support RHEL-7 as a build
    target. This lets us increment the minimum required nettle version and
    drop a lot of backwards compatibility code for 2.x series of nettle.
    
    Per repology, current shipping versions are:
    
                 RHEL-8: 3.4.1
          Debian Buster: 3.4.1
     openSUSE Leap 15.2: 3.4.1
       Ubuntu LTS 18.04: 3.4
       Ubuntu LTS 20.04: 3.5.1
                FreeBSD: 3.7.2
              Fedora 33: 3.5.1
              Fedora 34: 3.7.2
                OpenBSD: 3.7.2
         macOS HomeBrew: 3.7.2
    
    Ubuntu LTS 18.04 has the oldest version and so 3.4 is the new minimum.
