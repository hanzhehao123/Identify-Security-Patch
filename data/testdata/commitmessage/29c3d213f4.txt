    oslib-posix: Remove OpenBSD workaround for fcntl("/dev/null", F_SETFL, O_NONBLOCK) failure
    
    OpenBSD prior to 6.3 required a workaround to utilize fcntl(F_SETFL) on memory
    devices.
    
    Since modern verions of OpenBSD that are only officialy supported and buildable
    on do not have this issue I am garbage collecting this workaround.
