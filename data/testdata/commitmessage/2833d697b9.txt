    jackaudio: avoid that the client name contains the word (NULL)
    
    Currently with jackaudio client name and qemu guest name unset,
    the JACK client names are out-(NULL) and in-(NULL). These names
    are user visible in the patch bay. Replace the function call to
    qemu_get_vm_name() with a call to audio_application_name() which
    replaces NULL with "qemu" to have more descriptive names.
