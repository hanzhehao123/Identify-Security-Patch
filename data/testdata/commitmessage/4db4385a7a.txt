    i386: run accel_cpu_instance_init as post_init
    
    This fixes host and max cpu initialization, by running the accel cpu
    initialization only after all instance init functions are called for all
    X86 cpu subclasses.
    
    The bug this is fixing is related to the "max" and "host" i386 cpu
    subclasses, which set cpu->max_features, which is then used at cpu
    realization time.
    
    In order to properly split the accel-specific max features code that
    needs to be executed at cpu instance initialization time,
    
    we cannot call the accel cpu initialization at the end of the x86 base
    class initialization, or we will have no way to specialize
    "max features" cpu behavior, overriding the "max" cpu class defaults,
    and checking for the "max features" flag itself.
    
    This patch moves the accel-specific cpu instance initialization to after
    all x86 cpu instance code has been executed, including subclasses,
    
    so that proper initialization of cpu "host" and "max" can be restored.
