    target/ppc: added ifdefs around TCG-only code
    
    excp_helper.c, mmu-hash64.c and mmu_helper.c have some function
    declarations that are TCG-only, and couldn't be easily moved to a
    TCG only file, so ifdefs were added around them.
    
    We also needed ifdefs around some header files because helper-proto.h
    includes trace/generated-helpers.h, which is never created when building
    without TCG, and cpu_ldst.h includes tcg/tcg.h, whose containing folder
    is not included as a -iquote. As future cleanup, we could change the
    part of the configuration script to add those.
    
    cpu_init.c also had a callback definition that is TCG only and could be
    removed as part of a future cleanup (all the dump_statistics part is
    almost never used and will become obsolete as we transition to using
    decodetree).
