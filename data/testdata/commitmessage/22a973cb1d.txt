    python/qemu: add isort to pipenv
    
    isort 5.0.0 through 5.0.4 has a bug that causes it to misinterpret
    certain "from ..." clauses that are not related to imports.
    
    isort < 5.1.1 has a bug where it does not handle comments near import
    statements correctly.
    
    Require 5.1.2 or greater.
    
    isort can be run (in "check" mode) with 'isort -c qemu' from the python
    root. isort can also be used to fix/rewrite import order automatically
    by using 'isort qemu'.
