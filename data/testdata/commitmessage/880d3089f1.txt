    esp: allow non-DMA callback in esp_transfer_data() initial transfer
    
    The current implementation only resumes DMA transfers when incoming data is
    received from the target device, but this is also required for non-DMA transfers
    with the next set of non-DMA changes.
    
    Rather than duplicate the DMA/non-DMA dispatch logic in the initial transfer
    section, update the code so that the initial transfer section can just
    fallthrough to the main DMA/non-DMA dispatch logic.
