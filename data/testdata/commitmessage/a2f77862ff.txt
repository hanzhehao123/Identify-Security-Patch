    KVM: Use a big lock to replace per-kml slots_lock
    
    Per-kml slots_lock will bring some trouble if we want to take all slots_lock of
    all the KMLs, especially when we're in a context that we could have taken some
    of the KML slots_lock, then we even need to figure out what we've taken and
    what we need to take.
    
    Make this simple by merging all KML slots_lock into a single slots lock.
    
    Per-kml slots_lock isn't anything that helpful anyway - so far only x86 has two
    address spaces (so, two slots_locks).  All the rest archs will be having one
    address space always, which means there's actually one slots_lock so it will be
    the same as before.
