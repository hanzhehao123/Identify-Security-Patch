    scsi-generic: pass max_segments via max_iov field in BlockLimits
    
    I/O to a disk via read/write is not limited by the number of segments allowed
    by the host adapter; the kernel can split requests if needed, and the limit
    imposed by the host adapter can be very low (256k or so) to avoid that SG_IO
    returns EINVAL if memory is heavily fragmented.
    
    Since this value is only interesting for SG_IO-based I/O, do not include
    it in the max_transfer and only take it into account when patching the
    block limits VPD page in the scsi-generic device.
