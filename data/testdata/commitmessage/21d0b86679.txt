    python: add excluded dirs to flake8 config
    
    Instruct flake8 to avoid certain well-known directories created by
    python tooling that it ought not check.
    
    Note that at-present, nothing actually creates a ".venv" directory; but
    it is in such widespread usage as a de-facto location for a developer's
    virtual environment that it should be excluded anyway. A forthcoming
    commit canonizes this with a "make venv" command.
