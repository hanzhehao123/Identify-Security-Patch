    ui: Make the DisplayType enum entries conditional
    
    Libvirt's "domcapabilities" command has a way to state whether certain
    graphic frontends are available in QEMU or not. Originally, libvirt
    looked at the "--help" output of the QEMU binary to determine whether
    SDL was available or not (by looking for the "-sdl" parameter in the
    help text), but since libvirt stopped doing this analysis of the help
    text, the detection of SDL is currently broken, see:
    
     https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1790902
    
    QEMU should provide a way via the QMP interface instead. A simple way,
    without introducing additional commands, is to make the DisplayType
    enum entries conditional, so that the enum only contains the entries if
    the corresponding CONFIG_xxx switches have been set. This of course
    only gives an indication which possibilities have been enabled during
    compile-time of QEMU (and does not take into account whether modules
    are later available or not for example - for this we'd need a separate
    command), but anyway, this should already be good enough for the above
    bug ticket, and it's a good idea anyway to make the QMP interface
    conditional here, so let's simply do it.
