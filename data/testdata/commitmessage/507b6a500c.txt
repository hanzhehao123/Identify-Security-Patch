    target/arm: Implement MVE VLDR/VSTR (non-widening forms)
    
    Implement the forms of the MVE VLDR and VSTR insns which perform
    non-widening loads of bytes, halfwords or words from memory into
    vector elements of the same width (encodings T5, T6, T7).
    
    (At the moment we know for MVE and M-profile in general that
    vfp_access_check() can never return false, but we include the
    conventional return-true-on-failure check for consistency
    with non-M-profile translation code.)
