    target/arm: Use acpi_ghes_present() to see if we report ACPI memory errors
    
    The virt_is_acpi_enabled() function is specific to the virt board, as
    is the check for its 'ras' property.  Use the new acpi_ghes_present()
    function to check whether we should report memory errors via
    acpi_ghes_record_errors().
    
    This avoids a link error if QEMU was built without support for the
    virt board, and provides a mechanism that can be used by any future
    board models that want to add ACPI memory error reporting support
    (they only need to call acpi_ghes_add_fw_cfg()).
