    sev: use explicit indices for mapping firmware error codes to strings
    
    This can help lower any margin for error when making future additions to
    the list, especially if they're made out of order.
    
    While doing so, make capitalization of ASID consistent with its usage in
    the SEV firmware spec (Asid -> ASID).
