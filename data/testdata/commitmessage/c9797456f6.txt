    osdep: provide ROUND_DOWN macro
    
    osdep.h provides a ROUND_UP macro to hide bitwise operations for the
    purpose of rounding a number up to a power of two; add a ROUND_DOWN
    macro that does the same with truncation towards zero.
    
    While at it, change the formatting of some comments.
