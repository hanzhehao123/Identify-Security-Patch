    python/pipenv: Update Pipfile.lock
    
    In a previous commit, I added tox to the development requirements of the
    Python library. I never bothered to add them to the Pipfile, because
    they aren't needed there. Here, I sync it anyway in its own commit so
    that when we add new packages later that the diffstats will not
    confusingly appear to pull in lots of extra packages.
    
    Ideally I could tell Pipenv simply not to install these, but it doesn't
    seem to support that, exactly. The alternative is removing Tox from the
    development requires, which I'd rather not do.
    
    The other alternative is re-specifying all of the dependencies of
    setup.cfg in the Pipfile, which I'd also rather not do.
    
    Picking what feels least-worst here.
