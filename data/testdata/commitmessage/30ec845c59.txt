    scripts/qom-fuse: add static type hints
    
    Because fusepy does not have type hints, add some targeted warning
    suppressions.
    
    Namely, we need to allow subclassing something of an unknown type (in
    qom_fuse.py), and we need to allow missing imports (recorded against
    fuse itself) because mypy will be unable to import fusepy (even when
    installed) as it has no types nor type stubs available.
    
    Note: Until now, it was possible to run invocations like 'mypy qemu/'
    from ./python and have that work. However, these targeted suppressions
    require that you run 'mypy -p qemu/' instead. The correct, canonical
    invocation is recorded in ./python/tests/mypy.sh and all of the various
    CI invocations always use this correct form.
