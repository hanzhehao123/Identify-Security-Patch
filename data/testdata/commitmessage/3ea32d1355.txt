    vhost-user-gpu: abstract vg_cleanup_mapping_iov
    
    Currently in vhost-user-gpu, we free resource directly in
    the cleanup case of resource. If we change the cleanup logic
    we need to change several places, also abstruct a
    'vg_create_mapping_iov' can be symmetry with the
    'vg_create_mapping_iov'. This is like what virtio-gpu does,
    no function changed.
