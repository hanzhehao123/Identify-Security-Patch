    softmmu/physmem: Mark shared anonymous memory RAM_SHARED
    
    Let's drop the "shared" parameter from ram_block_add() and properly
    store it in the flags of the ram block instead, such that
    qemu_ram_is_shared() properly succeeds on all ram blocks that were mapped
    MAP_SHARED.
    
    We'll use this information next to fix some cases with shared anonymous
    memory.
