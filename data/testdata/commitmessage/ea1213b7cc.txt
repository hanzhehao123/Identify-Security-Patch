    python: add qemu package installer
    
    Add setup.cfg and setup.py, necessary for installing a package via
    pip. Add a ReST document (PACKAGE.rst) explaining the basics of what
    this package is for and who to contact for more information. This
    document will be used as the landing page for the package on PyPI.
    
    List the subpackages we intend to package by name instead of using
    find_namespace because find_namespace will naively also packages tests,
    things it finds in the dist/ folder, etc. I could not figure out how to
    modify this behavior; adding allow/deny lists to setuptools kept
    changing the packaged hierarchy. This works, roll with it.
    
    I am not yet using a pyproject.toml style package manifest, because
    "editable" installs are not defined (yet?) by PEP-517/518.
    
    I consider editable installs crucial for development, though they have
    (apparently) always been somewhat poorly defined.
    
    Pip now (19.2 and later) now supports editable installs for projects
    using pyproject.toml manifests, but might require the use of the
    --no-use-pep517 flag, which somewhat defeats the point. Full support for
    setup.py-less editable installs was not introduced until pip 21.1.1:

    For now, while the dust settles, stick with the de-facto
    setup.py/setup.cfg combination supported by setuptools. It will be worth
    re-evaluating this point again in the future when our supported build
    platforms all ship a fairly modern pip.
