    python: add MANIFEST.in
    
    When creating a source or binary distribution via 'python3 setup.py
    <sdist|bdist>', the VERSION and PACKAGE.rst files aren't bundled by
    default. Create a MANIFEST.in file that instructs the build tools to
    include these so that installation from these files won't fail.
    
    This is required by 'tox', as well as by the tooling needed to upload
    packages to PyPI.
    
    Exclude the 'README.rst' file -- that's intended as a guidebook to our
    source tree, not a file that needs to be distributed.
