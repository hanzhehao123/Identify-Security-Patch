    KVM: Create the KVMSlot dirty bitmap on flag changes
    
    Previously we have two places that will create the per KVMSlot dirty
    bitmap:
    
      1. When a newly created KVMSlot has dirty logging enabled,
      2. When the first log_sync() happens for a memory slot.
    
    The 2nd case is lazy-init, while the 1st case is not (which is a fix
    of what the 2nd case missed).
    
    To do explicit initialization of dirty bitmaps, what we're missing is
    to create the dirty bitmap when the slot changed from not-dirty-track
    to dirty-track.  Do that in kvm_slot_update_flags().
    
    With that, we can safely remove the 2nd lazy-init.
    
    This change will be needed for kvm dirty ring because kvm dirty ring
    does not use the log_sync() interface at all.
    
    Also move all the pre-checks into kvm_slot_init_dirty_bitmap().
