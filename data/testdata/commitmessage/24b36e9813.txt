    block: add max_hw_transfer to BlockLimits
    
    For block host devices, I/O can happen through either the kernel file
    descriptor I/O system calls (preadv/pwritev, io_submit, io_uring)
    or the SCSI passthrough ioctl SG_IO.
    
    In the latter case, the size of each transfer can be limited by the
    HBA, while for file descriptor I/O the kernel is able to split and
    merge I/O in smaller pieces as needed.  Applying the HBA limits to
    file descriptor I/O results in more system calls and suboptimal
    performance, so this patch splits the max_transfer limit in two:
    max_transfer remains valid and is used in general, while max_hw_transfer
    is limited to the maximum hardware size.  max_hw_transfer can then be
    included by the scsi-generic driver in the block limits page, to ensure
    that the stricter hardware limit is used.
