    docs: fix references to docs/specs/tpm.rst
    
    Commit 6e8a3ff6ed ("docs/specs/tpm: reST-ify TPM documentation")
    converted docs/specs/tpm.txt to docs/specs/tpm.rst.
    
    We still have several references to the old file, so let's fix them
    with the following command:
    
      sed -i s/tpm.txt/tpm.rst/ $(git grep -l docs/specs/tpm.txt)
