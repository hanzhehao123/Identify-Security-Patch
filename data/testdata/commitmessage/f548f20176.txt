    arm: Consistently use "Cortex-Axx", not "Cortex Axx"
    
    The official punctuation for Arm CPU names uses a hyphen, like
    "Cortex-A9". We mostly follow this, but in a few places usage
    without the hyphen has crept in. Fix those so we consistently
    use the same way of writing the CPU name.
