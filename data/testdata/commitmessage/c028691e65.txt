    tests/acceptance/virtiofs_submounts.py: evaluate string not length
    
    If the vmlinuz variable is set to anything that evaluates to True,
    then the respective arguments should be set.  If the variable contains
    an empty string, than it will evaluate to False, and the extra
    arguments will not be set.
    
    This keeps the same logic, but improves readability a bit.
