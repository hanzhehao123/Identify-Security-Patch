    iotests/297: add --namespace-packages to mypy arguments
    
    mypy is kind of weird about how it handles imports. For legacy reasons,
    it won't load PEP 420 namespaces, because of logic implemented prior to
    that becoming a standard.
    
    So, if you plan on using any, you have to pass
    --namespace-packages. Alright, fine.
