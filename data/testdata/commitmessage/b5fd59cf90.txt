    virtiofsd: Set req->reply_sent right after sending reply
    
    There is no reason to set it in label "err". We should be able to set
    it right after sending reply. It is easier to read.
    
    Also got rid of label "err" because now only thing it was doing was
    return a code. We can return from the error location itself and no
    need to first jump to label "err".
