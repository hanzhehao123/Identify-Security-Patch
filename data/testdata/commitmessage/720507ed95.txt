    ratelimit: treat zero speed as unlimited
    
    Both users of RateLimit, block-copy.c and blockjob.c, treat
    a speed of zero as unlimited, while RateLimit treats it as
    "as slow as possible".  The latter is nicer from the code
    point of view but pretty useless, so disable rate limiting
    if a speed of zero is provided.
