    tpm: Return QMP error when TPM is disabled in build
    
    When the management layer queries a binary built using --disable-tpm
    for TPM devices, it gets confused by getting empty responses:
    
      { "execute": "query-tpm" }
      {
          "return": [
          ]
      }
      { "execute": "query-tpm-types" }
      {
          "return": [
          ]
      }
      { "execute": "query-tpm-models" }
      {
          "return": [
          ]
      }
    
    To make it clearer by returning an error:
    - Make the TPM QAPI schema conditional
      All of tpm.json is now 'if': 'defined(CONFIG_TPM)'.
    - Adapt the HMP command
    - Remove stubs which became unnecessary
    
    The management layer now gets a 'CommandNotFound' error:
    
      { "execute": "query-tpm" }
      {
          "error": {
              "class": "CommandNotFound",
              "desc": "The command query-tpm has not been found"
          }
      }
