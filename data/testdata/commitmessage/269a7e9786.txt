    docs: Fix installation of man pages with Sphinx 4.x
    
    The 4.x branch of Sphinx introduces a breaking change, as generated man
    pages are now written to subdirectories corresponding to the manual
    section they belong to. This results in `make install` erroring out when
    attempting to install the man pages, because they are not where it
    expects to find them.
    
    This patch restores the behavior of Sphinx 3.x regarding man pages.
