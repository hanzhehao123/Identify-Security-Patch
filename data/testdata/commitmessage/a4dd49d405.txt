    python/qemu: add qemu package itself to pipenv
    
    This adds the python qemu packages themselves to the pipenv manifest.
    'pipenv sync' will create a virtual environment sufficient to use the SDK.
    'pipenv sync --dev' will create a virtual environment sufficient to use
    and test the SDK (with pylint, mypy, isort, flake8, etc.)
    
    The qemu packages are installed in 'editable' mode; all changes made to
    the python package inside the git tree will be reflected in the
    installed package without reinstallation. This includes changes made
    via git pull and so on.
