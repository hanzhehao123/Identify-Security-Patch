    spapr: Set LPCR to current AIL mode when starting a new CPU
    
    TCG does not keep track of AIL mode in a central place, it's based on
    the current LPCR[AIL] bits. Synchronize the new CPU's LPCR to the
    current LPCR in rtas_start_cpu(), similarly to the way the ILE bit is
    synchronized.
    
    Open-code the ILE setting as well now that the caller's LPCR is
    available directly, there is no need for the indirection.
    
    Without this, under both TCG and KVM, adding a POWER8/9/10 class CPU
    with a new core ID after a modern Linux has booted results in the new
    CPU's LPCR missing the LPCR[AIL]=0b11 setting that the other CPUs have.
    This can cause crashes and unexpected behaviour.
