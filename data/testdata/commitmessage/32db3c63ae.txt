    virtio-gpu: Add virtio_gpu_set_scanout_blob
    
    This API allows Qemu to set the blob allocated by the Guest as
    the scanout buffer. If Opengl support is available, then the
    scanout buffer would be submitted as a dmabuf to the UI; if not,
    a pixman image is created from the scanout buffer and is
    submitted to the UI via the display surface.
