    vfio: Fix unregister SaveVMHandler in vfio_migration_finalize
    
    In the vfio_migration_init(), the SaveVMHandler is registered for
    VFIO device. But it lacks the operation of 'unregister'. It will
    lead to 'Segmentation fault (core dumped)' in
    qemu_savevm_state_setup(), if performing live migration after a
    VFIO device is hot deleted.
