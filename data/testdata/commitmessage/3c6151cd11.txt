    hw/usb: hcd-xhci-pci: Raise MSI/MSI-X interrupts only when told to
    
    At present MSI / MSI-X interrupts are triggered regardless of the
    irq level. We should have checked the level to determine whether
    the interrupt needs to be delivered.
    
    The level check logic was present in early versions of the xhci
    model, but got dropped later by a rework of interrupt handling
    under commit 4c4abe7cc903 ("xhci: rework interrupt handling").
