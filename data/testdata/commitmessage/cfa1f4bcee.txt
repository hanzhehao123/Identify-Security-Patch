    hw/mem/nvdimm: Use Kconfig 'imply' instead of 'depends on'
    
    Per the kconfig.rst:
    
      A device should be listed [...] ``imply`` if (depending on
      the QEMU command line) the board may or  may not be started
      without it.
    
    This is the case with the NVDIMM device, so use the 'imply'
    weak reverse dependency to select the symbol.
