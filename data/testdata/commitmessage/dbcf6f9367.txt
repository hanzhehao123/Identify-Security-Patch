    bitops.h: Provide hswap32(), hswap64(), wswap64() swapping operations
    
    Currently the ARM SVE helper code defines locally some utility
    functions for swapping 16-bit halfwords within 32-bit or 64-bit
    values and for swapping 32-bit words within 64-bit values,
    parallel to the byte-swapping bswap16/32/64 functions.
    
    We want these also for the ARM MVE code, and they're potentially
    generally useful for other targets, so move them to bitops.h.
    (We don't put them in bswap.h with the bswap* functions because
    they are implemented in terms of the rotate operations also
    defined in bitops.h, and including bitops.h from bswap.h seems
    better avoided.)
