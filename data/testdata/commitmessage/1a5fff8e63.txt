    virtiofsd: Check EOF before short read
    
    In virtio_send_data_iov() we are checking first for short read and then
    EOF condition. Change the order. Basically check for error and EOF first
    and last remaining piece is short ready which will lead to retry
    automatically at the end of while loop.
    
    Just that it is little simpler to read to the code. There is no need
    to call "continue" and also one less call of "len-=ret".
