    softfloat: Move floatN_log2 to softfloat-parts.c.inc
    
    Rename to parts$N_log2.  Though this is partly a ruse, since I do not
    believe the code will succeed for float128 without work.  Which is ok
    for now, because we do not need this for more than float32 and float64.
    
    Since berkeley-testfloat-3 doesn't support log2, compare float64_log2
    vs the system log2.  Fix the errors for inputs near 1.0:
