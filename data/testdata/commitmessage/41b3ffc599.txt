    target/arm/translate-vfp.c: Whitespace fixes
    
    In the code for handling VFP system register accesses there is some
    stray whitespace after a unary '-' operator, and also some incorrect
    indent in a couple of function prototypes.  We're about to move this
    code to another file, so fix the code style issues first so
    checkpatch doesn't complain about the code-movement patch.
