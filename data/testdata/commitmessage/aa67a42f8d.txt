    pckbd: add controller response queue
    
    Add a separate queue for PS/2 controller responses. The
    responses no longer get queued in the keyboard or mouse queues.
    The advantage of this can be seen after the next two patches,
    where the guest can disable the PS/2 communication with keyboard
    and mouse and still talk to the PS/2 controller.
