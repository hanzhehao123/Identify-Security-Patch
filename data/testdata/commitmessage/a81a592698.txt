    KVM: Disable manual dirty log when dirty ring enabled
    
    KVM_CAP_MANUAL_DIRTY_LOG_PROTECT2 is for KVM_CLEAR_DIRTY_LOG, which is only
    useful for KVM_GET_DIRTY_LOG.  Skip enabling it for kvm dirty ring.
    
    More importantly, KVM_DIRTY_LOG_INITIALLY_SET will not wr-protect all the pages
    initially, which is against how kvm dirty ring is used - there's no way for kvm
    dirty ring to re-protect a page before it's notified as being written first
    with a GFN entry in the ring!  So when KVM_DIRTY_LOG_INITIALLY_SET is enabled
    with dirty ring, we'll see silent data loss after migration.
