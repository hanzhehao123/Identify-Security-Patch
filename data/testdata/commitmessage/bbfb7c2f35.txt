    block/nbd: safer transition to receiving request
    
    req->receiving is a flag of request being in one concrete yield point
    in nbd_co_do_receive_one_chunk().
    
    Such kind of boolean flag is always better to unset before scheduling
    the coroutine, to avoid double scheduling. So, let's be more careful.
